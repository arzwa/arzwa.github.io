**Arthur Zwaenepoel**  (Gent °1995). I am currently a PhD student in the group
of professor Yves Van de Peer, conducting research on the evolutionary
importance of polyploidy. In practice I have mainly worked on statistical
phylogenetic methods for the inference of genome duplications from comparative
genomic data and modeling of gene family evolution, where I have come to prefer
a Bayesian approach towards statistics.  More broadly, my main research
interests are (theoretical) evolutionary genetics and probabilistic modeling in
biology. I also take a strong interest in philosophy and mathematics, but claim
little expertise there. I enjoy music, literature, computer programming,
playing music, long(ish)-distance running and traveling by bicycle.

## Code

All my code that is to some extent usable can be found on
[github](https://github.com/arzwa/wgd).

[Whale](https://github.com/arzwa/Whale.jl): Flexible Bayesian gene tree
reconciliation using amalgamated likelihood estimation and probabilistic
programming.

[DeadBird](https://github.com/arzwa/DeadBird.jl/): Statistical analysis of
comparative genomic data using phylogenetic birth-death process models. 
Still in a quite experimental stage.

[TwoTypeDLModel](https://github.com/arzwa/TwoTypeDLModel): Inference for a two
type continuous-time branching process model of gene family evolution. I did
not look for a clever name for this one -- it's quite specialized on one thing
anyway.

[Beluga](https://github.com/arzwa/Beluga.jl): Reversible-jump MCMC for
model-based inference of ancient WGD events using gene count data.

[wgd](https://github.com/arzwa/wgd): simple command line tools for estimating
$K_\mathrm{S}$ distributions, synteny analyses and visualization of these
things to unveil ancient WGD events.
