My name is Arthur (Zwaenepoel). Eschewing modern social media, and awaiting
general recognition in the form of a wikipedia page, I grant you the privilege
to find here my spot on the www. Being a huge fan of the personal webpage,
especially of the academic type (find some of my favourite examples
[here](links)), I could not resist embarking on this wonderful vanity project.

My main occupation is currently studying and doing research in the field of
evolutionary biology, being a PhD student in the lab of Yves Van de Peer at
Ghent University. A computational biologist by training, I try to use and
develop bioinformatics, statistics and some mathematics to understand living
things. In my PhD project, I am focusing on the importance of polyploidy in
plant evolution. For some methods and tools (wgd, Whale) I've developed,
see [github](https://github.com/arzwa).

Besides doing evolutionary biology, I really dig reading philosophy and the
occasional novel, other fields of science (mainly probability and statistics,
some other mathematics and computer science where feasible), music (in
particular ambient, 'modern' classical music (mostly of the minimalistic and
avant-garde kind), jazz, soul, not to forget japanese city pop and all those
rare 'poppy' gems that one finds from time to time; have a look [here](mubb)
for some all-time favourite records), making music (see
[bandcamp](https://bruinebeer.bandcamp.com/)) and being outside (walking, the
occasional run, cycling, sailing).
