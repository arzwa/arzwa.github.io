**Arthur Zwaenepoel** (Ghent, Belgium) -- while waiting for general recognition
in the form of a wikipedia page, you can find my spot on the www here. I am a
PhD student in evolutionary biology, statistics and bioinformatics (in the
sense that I am working in areas where these three meet, I'm not doing three
PhDs). In the biological realm, I am currently working on the evolutionary
importance of polyploidy. In practice however I have mainly worked on
phylogenetic methods. Here I have come to prefer a Bayesian approach towards
modeling and inference. Besides these scientific interests and occupations, I
enjoy philosophy, coding, music, literature, cycling and running.
