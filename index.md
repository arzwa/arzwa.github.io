My name is Arthur (Zwaenepoel). Awaiting general recognition in the form 
of a wikipedia page, you can find my spot on the www here. 

My main occupation is currently studying and doing research in the field of
evolutionary biology, being a PhD student in the lab of Yves Van de Peer at
Ghent University. A computational biologist by training, I try to use and
develop bioinformatics, statistics and some mathematics to understand living
things. In my PhD project, I am focusing on the importance of polyploidy in
plant evolution and the probabilistic modeling of gene family evolution. For 
some methods and tools (wgd, Whale) I've developed, see [github](https://github.com/arzwa).

Besides doing evolutionary biology, I really enjoy reading philosophy and the
occasional novel, other fields of science (mainly probability and statistics,
some other mathematics and computer science where feasible), music (in
particular ambient, classical music (mostly post-WWII), jazz, soul and some 
(often non-western) pop music (e.g. japanese city pop, Demis Roussos, italian 
70s and 80s pop music); have a look [here](mubb) for some all-time favourite 
records), making music (see [bandcamp](https://bruinebeer.bandcamp.com/)) and 
being outside (walking, running, cycling, sailing).
