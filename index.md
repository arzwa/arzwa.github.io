[Computing $\ks$ distributions with wgd](ksd) 

**Arthur Zwaenepoel** (Ghent, Belgium) -- I am a PhD student in evolutionary
biology, statistics and bioinformatics (in the sense that I am working in areas
where these three meet, I'm not doing three PhDs). In the biological realm, I 
am currently working on the evolutionary importance of polyploidy. In practice 
however I have mainly worked on phylogenetic methods. Here I have come to prefer 
a Bayesian approach towards modeling and inference. Besides these scientific 
interests and occupations, I enjoy philosophy, coding, music, literature, 
cycling and running.
