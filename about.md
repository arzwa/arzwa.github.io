**Arthur Zwaenepoel** (Gent °1995).
I studied molecular biology and bioinformatics at Ghent University (2012-2017),
and later did my PhD on Bayesian statistical methods in evolutionary genomics
in the [group of prof.  Yves Van de Peer](https://www.vandepeerlab.org/)
(2017-2022).
My current research focus is theoretical evolutionary genetics, starting a
postdoc with [Christelle Fraïsse](https://sites.google.com/view/cfraisserios)
in November 2022.
I retain strong interests in Bayesian statistics, philosophy, programming,
theoretical biology *etc.*
