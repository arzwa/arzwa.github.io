			<p>
			<i>Scroll down for audio and examples</i>. As a musician I'm sometimes
			tired of searching for chords and melodies, as for me the more fun
			part is manipulating them. The world around us luckily happens to
			be full of sequences, which can be easly interpreted as a melody
			provided a basic set of rules. As a <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics">bioinformatician</a>
			and evolutionary biologist, I work with sequences constantly,
			originating from biological macromolecules (DNA, RNA and proteins).
			These sequences with their different respective codes (4
			nucleotides for DNA and RNA, 20 amino acids for proteins) can be
			readily interpreted as linear melodies, providing the horizontal
			musical progress for a piece. This actually has been done before
			and one of the first persons to interpret biological macromolecules
			as musical information was the great evolutionairy biologist <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susumu_Ohno">Susumu Ohno</a>,
			mainly known for his seminal work in molecular evolution and the
			study of the influence of gene duplications on evolution (his
			classic, but rarely read, book Evolution by Gene Duplication (1970)
			is dedicated to this matter, see for example Hahn (2009) for a commentary
			on Ohno's <i>magnum opus</i>[1]).
			</p>

			<p>
			Ohno's musical interpretation of genetic codes was not just playful
			sidenote in his research, he was really fascinated about the
			resulting pieces of music. He noted for example that a translation
			of the SARC oncogene (genes known to be involved in initiating and
			accelerating cancers) sounded quite like the funeral mars of
			Chopin: "It was sad, somber, and somewhat out of control, Really
			amazing.". In contrast, the song of a human antibody that breaks
			down the toxic chemical hydroxynitrolphenol turned out to be,
			"livelier, more chipper, helpful". Also when converting
			compositions of great composers to genetic code, he noted that the
			resuling stretches of coding sequences resembled known genes, for
			example for the Chopin F-Minor Nocturne, Opus 55, No. 1, he says
			that it reproduced the structure of the RNA polymerase II. He was
			fascinated by repetition, periodicity and endless cycles, he
			regarded these phenomena as the essence of life on earth (see this
			<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3744439">article</a>
			and this <a
			href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3443409">article</a> for
			example). But he went quite far with his thoughts on the
			relationship between music and genes and things start to sound like
			some pythagorean cult (read <a
			href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-04-16/features/8601270812_1_original-genes-scientists-msic">this</a>).
			</p>

			<p>
			At this moment I'm not (yet) really convinced of wether it is
			meaningful to search for relationships between music and
			(molecular) evolution, however it is at least an interesting notion
			and I consider giving it further thought. Nevertheless, the
			sequences still <i>can</i> be interpreted musically, and therefore
			may guide artistic processes, in a similar way the <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching">I Ching</a> (book of
			changes) guided the musical composition of <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cage">John Cage</a>. Cage
			used the I Ching to compose music free of his personal tastes and
			intuitions, entirely originating from chance operations, "imitating
			nature in its manner of operation" in his own words. In a very
			similar way, and even more directly imitating nature, biological
			sequences can be used for making musical compositions, with the
			resulting music reflecting millions of years of evolution through
			random mutation and natural selection. (Note: this is under the
			assumption that my personal choice of gene families is not
			systematically linked with a certain sequence (and therefore
			musical) pattern, an assumption of which Ohno would doubt the
			validity).
			</p>

			<p>
			It seems that every student in molecular biology or bioinformatics
			that has affinity with music comes up with the idea to convert
			biological sequences to music one time (it even has a <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_music">wikipedia
			page</a>), see also the <a href='#footnotes'>footnotes</a> below.
			However I wanted to give it a shot as well. Also most
			approaches I've encountered of making biological sequence inspired
			music are inspired on single linear sequences, resulting in the
			horizontal melodic aspect of music. However by combining <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthologous_gene">orthologous
			genes</a> that form a <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_family">gene family</a>
			(i.e. closely related sequences that are derived from a same common
			ancestral gene), a vertical (harmonic) musical structure can be
			inferred, namely by generating <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sequence_alignment">
			multiple sequence alignments</a> (where columns represent
			simultaneously sounding notes i.e. chords).  This results in a
			generative piece of music in both the vertical and horizontal
			dimension, visualized by the multiple sequence alignment. Note that
			multiple sequence alignments are often used to compute <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree">phylogenetic
			trees</a>, which happens to be an aesthetically pleasing
			representation to guide the music. The basic approach
			adopted to make music with these alignments is to define a set of
			rules translating amino acids or nucleotides to notes, convert the
			multiple sequence alignment to a "score" and than generate a MIDI
			file with that score. <code>orthosong</code> is available <a
			href="https://github.com/arzwa/orthosong">here</a>.

			The all pervasive principle of repetitious recurrence governs not
			only coding sequence construction but also human endeavor in
			musical composition.</a>
			<i>
			"Organisms which have evolved on this earth are governed by
			multitudes of periodicities; tomorrow is another today, and the
			next year is going to be much like this year. Accordingly, the
			principle of repetitious recurrence pervades every aspect of life
			on this earth. Thus, individual genes in the genome have been
			duplicated and triplicated often to the point of redundancy, and
			each coding sequence consists of numerous variously truncated as
			well as variously base-substituted copies of the original
			primordial building block base oligomers and their allies. This
			principle even appears to govern the manifestations of human
			intellect; musical compositions also rely on this principle of
			repetitious recurrence. Accordingly, coding base sequences can be
			transformed into musical scores using one set rule. Conversely,
			musical scores can be transcribed to coding base sequences of long
			open reading frames."</i> - Ohno & Ohno - Immunogenetics. 1986;
			</p>

			<a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3443409'>
			Repetition as the essence of life on this earth: music and genes.</a>

			<i>
			"In prebiotic nucleic acid replication, templates appear to have
			been in short supply. A single round of tandem duplication of
			existing oligomers assured progressive extension of templates to
			the length adequate for encoding of polypeptide chains. Thus, the
			first set of coding sequences had to be repeats of base oligomers
			encoding polypeptide chains of various periodicities. On one hand,
			the readiness of these periodical polypeptide chains to assume
			alpha-helical and/or beta-sheet secondary structures contributed to
			the extremely rapid initial functional diversification of these
			polypeptide chains. It would be recalled that most, if not all, of
			the sugar-metabolizing enzymes had already achieved the inviolable
			functional competence before the division of prokaryotes from
			eukaryotes. On the other hand, a certain (dipeptidic?) of the
			peptidic periodicities was apparently chosen as the timekeeping
			unit by the biological clock. Musical compositions too apparently
			evolved originally as a timekeeping device. Accordingly,
			repetitiousness is evident in all musical compositions. Evolution
			of musical compositions from the early Baroque to the late Romantic
			parallels that of coding sequences from rather exact repeats of
			base oligomers to more complex modern coding sequences in which
			repetitious elements are less conspicuous and more varied. Inasmuch
			as the earth is governed by the hierarchy of periodicities (days,
			months and years), such reliance on periodicities is rather
			expected."</i> - Ohno S. Haematol Blood Transfus. 1987
