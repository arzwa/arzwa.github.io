	<i>Kabbelen     - </i>This album mainly consists of three parts, though trying to remain a whole. Kabbelen is the
	main theme, the purposeless flowing of things, rivers, streams, thoughts, this music, ... It is not at all an album
	for active listening, it often is ambient music in the original sense, don't let it interfere, don't try not to fall
	asleep.

	The first part obviously is Desolaat (I, II & III). These tracks were inspired by the endless flowing of rivers and
	streams, momentarily and insignificantly captured with my recordings. I used a kind of free form mainly featuring
	open tuned acoustic guitar (besides field recordings), combined with some more "arranged" parts. While it starts in
	this very open form on Desolaat I, it evolves into the more repetitive sound of Desolaat III, floating into the
	second part of this album.

	Field recordings always document a certain location, even if not intended to do so, and we humans tend to be unable
	to really listen musically to ambience sounds. On Anser, Koninklijk baan Mariakerke (Oostende) and Beestenmarkt my
	goal was to put field recordings in a musical context, guiding the listener through it, keeping the recording as
	most crucial part without ending up with mere phonography (which I enjoy very much as well, if not more). On Anser,
	a winter recording featuring grey goose (<i>Anser anser</i>) and other birds in the natural park
	Bourgoyen-Ossemeersen (Ghent) is featured. An Oren Ambarchi like minimal bass line/drone is chosen as guiding music.
	The contrast between the beatiful bird sounds and a distant highway always struck me on this particular location.
	On Koninklijke baan Mariakerke (Oostende) one hears a recording on the dike in Mariakerke (Ostend) on a grey and
	drizzling day. Here the distant drone from the sea opposed to the machinal pulses of cars fascinates me.
	Some passing gulls finish the scene. Here I experimented with synthesizer drones in the higher register, giving this
	track a kind of "classic" ambient feel. Guitar and bass guide the listener to the end in a repetitive way. On
	Beestenmarkt a recording of the Oude Beestenmarkt (Ghent) is featured. At 7am sunday morning poultry farmers start
	setting up their stalls preparing for the animal market. It is an absurd contrast, these farmers getting up early
	for the animal market, a phenomenon that seems almost medieval, while the last party people from club69 are still
	walking around at the same city site. However here the sound of the roosters that all start to crow on different
	locations of the market is captured. An echoed flute motif dominates this piece, accompanied by some in house
	percussion and a dubby bassline, preparing the listener for more to come.

	The last part consists of two ambient dub tracks and lacks field recordings. Ambient dub I is a very minimal piece
	with a haunting atmosphere, consisting only of electric bass and synthesizer. It is the only track on this album
	where electrical "noise" was purposely introduced. The second dub track is very mellow and to fall asleep to, for
	those that did not yet. recordings of my purring cat can be heard. Still purposeless flowing music to relax, ignore
	or listen to. <i>- Bruine Beer</i> <br><br>
