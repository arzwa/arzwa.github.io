        <p>Glaswerk consists of six short pieces (only 11 minutes in duration) for an ensemble of three and
            five glasses, it is a naive attempt in making percussion music in the minimalist style, using stochastic
            elements (note the term ensemble in the previous sentence, it sounds funny). These pieces were composed
            using an alternative graphical representation in which different rhythmic motifs were arranged and allowed
            to be used modularly. The very intuitive representation allowed to include non-determined elements,
            introducing a stochastic component in some of the used modules. The different recorded modules were
            slightly manipulated using some fading and panning and arranged into six rather short pieces. Some reversed
            samples were used to enliven the compositions.

            These six pieces are an attempt to use a more systematic approach to a musical experiment. It is a musical
            experiment, in the Cageian sense, since the exact outcome was not known until it was performed. The usage of
            glasses is originating out of the love to make a musical instrument from every domestic object (also it is a
            very cheap way to get pitched percussion). The shortness of these pieces is in contrast with most minimalist
            percussion works. I think this shortness is in correspondence with the domestic aesthetic of these pieces
            and the fact that I do not want to pretend I am some kind of great composer. I think the work of Erik
            Thielemans inspired me to do a percussive experiment. Reading essays by John Cage and listening to the
            music of Lieven Martens encouraged me to take the approach of the composer, a position where I do not feel
            comfortable since I did not have any formal education. But who cares. Cage does not.
