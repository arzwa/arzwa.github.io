            <p>
                Some time ago (January 2016) I started a project where I would record roads, roads of different kinds,
                those I pass by while living my days. Listening to and recording roads is and was a quite shocking
                experience. The awareness that these noises are produced constantly on a worldly scale and that they
                invariably are part of the everyday soundscape is baffling. However, even more overwhelming is the
                indifference and disinterst of people towards these noises. It is as if everyone ignores the most insane
                piece of avant-garde noise music of extreme duration, and above all seems not to experience irritation.
                The deafening noise of the highway is shamelessly filtered away by our neurological system and nobody
                cares about the noises he/she is producing while driving his/her car.
            </p>
            <p>
                When we try to consider the sound <i>an sich</i> or try to put it in a musical context, the musicality
                is striking. The differences in dynamics and register as well as timbral differences impose themselves
                to the listener. Most peculiar are also the differences between different roads, which is the main merit
                of these recordings, namely the juxtaposition of different roads. The pulsating rhythym and
                repetitiveness of the E40 highway is in interesting contrast with the irregularity and diversity in
                sound observed at a roundabout of a middle sized road (Makro rondpunt (De Pinte)). Also the quality of
                the road, the presence of little puddles and cracks on the surface can render a total different
                soundscape (e.g. Langevelddreef (De Pinte)). Importantly, when considering roads in a musical context,
                the act of composing is reduced to choosing the moment of recording. Every other choice of recording
                moment will result in a new piece. In that sense, every recording of a road will remain an
                approximation, a captured moment of a never-ending piece.
            </p>
            <p>
                Recording roads will also always be a kind of activist thing to do. I do not like the constant presence
                of roads, cars and industrial sound, despite being able to appreciate it muscially. In that sense I am
                glad we humans can filter away these noises, we don't have to listen to avant-garde noise music all the
                time. However, due to this ignorance, we are not noticing that there are almost no plces left where no
                cars can be heard. It always strikes me when walking in the Ghent natural reserve Bourgoyen-ossemeersen
                how beautiful nature (and mostly birds) and traffic violence are so intimately and sadly juxtaposed. I'm
                sure I will keep writing and talking about roads, cars and traffic, as they will remain present in my
                field-recordings unfortunately.

        <p>
            <a href="http://www.123-piano.be/en">123 Piano</a> is a concept where several piano's are distributed across
            different city sites (in the city of Ghent). Everyone is free to play the piano's. It's a fantastic urban
            field-recording opportunity, putting in contrast musical sound, originating from carefully built musical
            instruments, with unintended noises from cars, busses and bicycles, as well as bypassing people.
            Interactions and relations between phonographic sound and canonical "musical" sound really fascinate me and
            for the careful listener, 123Piano is a fantastic case study. This recording on the Oude Beestenmarkt
            features two kids and their father at the piano. First the kids are fooling around, bringing forth musically
            very interesting pieces. Then the father plays a song (2 meisjes) of the in Ghent very famous songwriter
            Raymond Van Het Groenewoud, with of course fascinated kids as a result. Lastly they leave becasue their
            parking ticket will soon become invalid. The whole recording is made at about 6 meter from the piano,
            indicating the very obtrusive nature of the urban soundscape as the piano sounds far more distant and
            immersed in the noises from cars, construction works etc. Despite being able to appreciate the sounds of
            cars in a musical context, the excessive domination of car noises in the urban landscape makes me sad and
            sick.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the second recording the recorder is lying on the piano. One can here me (try) playing F&uumlr Alina,
            a piece from the Estonian composer Arvo P&aumlrt, and some subsequent improvisation. I am by no means a
            piano player, but enjoy pretending. The contrast of the heavenly music by P&aumlrt (in all humbleness played
            by myself) and the brutal urban soundscape, here more distant as the recorder is closer to the piano, is
            intriguing.

        <h3>The word "Phonography"</h3>
        <h4>Taken from Joel Smith (<a href="http://phonography.org/word.htm">phonography.org</a>)</h4>
        <p>
            The word "phonography" speaks to me precisely because, like "photography," it is <u>agnostic</u>; I mean
            it's factual rather than semantically loaded like "music" or "art" -- words that signal worthy ambitions and
            hierarchies that may, or may not, help you hear (or see) fresh. "Phonography" (translated literally) says
            nothing but: soundwriting. To me as a listener that means: audio "read" -- sound attended to -- for any
            revelations and resonances it turns up -- not only those that music knows how to handle, but the whole
            thing. (What does "audience" mean, after all?). Space, narrative, pain, hypnotism, temperature -- a sound's
            interesting dimension might be anywhere. Once you've listened to unauthored sounds in that spirit, music too
            sounds richer, more deeply authored (by the inventor of the drum, for example): fuller of history and space.
            Any time a sound is selected -- whether recorded, or just singled out ("listen!") -- attention has already
            transformed it.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Taken from Yitzchak Dumiel (Isaac Sterling)
            (<a href="http://phonography.org/whatis.htm">phonography.org</a>)
        </h4>
        <p>
            The simple answer is that phonography (literally "sound-writing") refers to field-recording. This entails
            the capture of any event that can be reproduced and represented as sound. Auditory events are selected,
            framed by duration and method of capture, and presented in a particular format and context, all of which
            distinguishes a recording from the original event during which it was captured. In this respect, phonography
            is analogous to any other form of recording. <u>It is distinct from recording in general only to the extent
            that the capture of sound is privileged over its production. This bias reflects an attempt to discover
            rather than invent.</u>
            
            Some useful analogies can be made between phonography and photography. The majority of early photographs
            were intended to be documentary or forensic, and many field-recordings serve these same purposes.
            Photographs made for enjoyment often emulated the aesthetics of more established forms of visual
            representation: painting and illustration. Many field-recordings also emulate aesthetics established by
            other media: e.g. a recording of a meadow or a souk in Cairo can be thought of as auditory equivalents of
            paintings or photographs; recordings are also used to present narratives similar to those typically conveyed
            by writing or film. Photography quickly developed beyond the cultural conventions prevalent at the time of
            its inception to become an endeavor preoccupied with more abstract and formal considerations (this
            transition can be viewed clearly in the work of photographers such as Edward Steichen and Edward Weston,
            or by contrasting photographs from 1900-20 with the work of Frederick Sommer and Minor White 3 decades
            later). A similar transition can be heard in phonography. Whereas the vast majority of field-recordings are
            manipulated as raw material for soundtracks and other auditory projects, and untreated field-recordings are
            used primarily for forensic and academic purposes, a new generation of recordists has emerged, preoccupied
            with the abstract and formal dimensions of captured environmental sound.
