    <p>After reading (or trying to read) <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/433235">this new PCI Evol. Biol. paper</a>,
I read Orr (2005)<sup id="fnref:orr2005"><a href="#fn:orr2005" class="footnote">1</a></sup> today, and what struck me is the complete
absence of an account of the more ‘genome evolution’ related processes
and how they contribute to adaptation in theoretically inclined work.
Fisher’s geometric model, the NK models, the mutational landscape model,
none of these accounts for evolutionary facts like duplication loss 
and genome rearrangements.</p>

<p>Fisher’s Geometrc model (FGM) is cool because of it’s quantitative 
genetics elegance, ‘statistical mechanics’-style (as Orr also explicitly
notes). That is of course one of its problems, since nowadays we’d like
to model evolution in terms of what happens at the genetic level more
explicitly. The other models address this, since they consider ‘sequence
space’. However they are confined to single genes, and are typically 
envisaged (I guess?) in rather concrete adaptational challenges, like
those encountered in microbial evolution (and evolutionary experiments).
For ‘complex’ organisms and more ‘general’ adaptive challenges (an 
organism moving to a different and unsuitable climate) the FGM is more
appealing with it’s account of pleiotropy and it’s applicability
to complex quantitative traits.</p>

<p>But then I start thinking about what these genomes actually look like,
and there is obviously a lot more going on than the kind of popgen
models of Gillespie and others. In plants at least, genomes seem very
‘dynamic’, and from the looks of it, these genomes are dominated by TE 
activity, duplication, loss, rearrangement and WGD. To me, and probably
many other evolutionary biologists not entirely focusing on popgen, 
it would seem (perhaps naively) that stuff like duplication and loss
are major sources of adaptation (and speciation, divergence etc). These
kinds of processes of course do fit in to some degree in the FGM, since
this is only defined at a phenotypic level (with strong assumptions on
the quantitative genetics of course).</p>

<p>Of course these are routine thoughts for someone studying evolution,
but an article titled “The genetic theory of adaptation” not mentioning
anything about</p>
