<hr />

<p>Consider a population with a quantitative trait $z$. We can try to think about
the distribution over trait values $p(z)$.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">p(z) = \int_{\xi \in \Xi} p(z, \xi)d\xi = \int_{\xi \in \Xi} p(z|\xi) p(\xi) d \xi</script>

<p>Where $\Xi$ is the space of all possible genotypes, which is such a hopeless
combinatorial mess that it is denoted by the most pedantic of greek letters,
capital xi. In an ideal world, the first density $p(z|\xi)$ is determined by a
comprehensive ‘genotype - phenotype map’, containing all sources of ‘phenotypic
plasticity’ and so-called ‘genotype $\times$ environment interactions’.</p>

<p>As a first restriction, we might wish to consider the distribution over trait
values conditional on a particular macro-evironment $E$</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">p(z|E) = \int_{\xi \in \Xi} p(z|\xi,E) p(\xi|E) d \xi</script>

<p>If we start thinking about transmission, we are in fact considering conditional
ditributions, <em>i.e.</em> $p(z’|z)$. Characterizing this density to the level of detail
required in a particular setting could perhaps be regarded as the core problem
in EQG.</p>

<p>Thinking about expectations instead of densities, conditional expectations
bring us in the sphere of regressions, which form the mathematical core of
classical quantitative genetics.</p>
