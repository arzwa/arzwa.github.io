character $z$, where $\mu_s$ denotes the population mean after selection but
&lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; reproduction.  Let $p(z)$ and $p_s(z)$ denote the frequency of
phenotype $z$ before and after selection respectively and $W(z)$ the abolute
fitness associated with the trait value $z$.  By definition of the mean we have&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\mu_s = \int_z z p_s(z) dz&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to find an expression for $p_s(z)$ to get further. $p_s(z)$ is of
course equal to $W(z)p(z)/\int_zW(z)p(z)dz$, where the denominator ensures that
$\int_z p_s(z) dz = \bar{W} = 1$ to form a proper density. We can define the
relative fitness as $w(z) = W(z) / \bar{W}$ so that we can write&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;p_s(z) = w(z) p(z)&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is a very intuitive expression relating the phenotypic distribution
before and after selection. We can now rewrite the expression for $mu_s$ as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\mu_s = \int_z z w(z) p(z) dz = \mathrm{E}(z w(z))&lt;/script&gt;

   &amp;=&amp; \sigma(z, w(z)) 
\end{eqnarray} %]]&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;that is, &lt;em&gt;the selection differential&lt;/em&gt; $S$ &lt;em&gt;is equal to the covariance of trait
value with relative fitness&lt;/em&gt;. This result is known as the Robertson-Price
identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now go to the offsping generation to investigate the effect of the selection
procedure.  We are interested in $\mu_o - \mu$, that is the change in trait
mean in the offspring generation due to selection. Considering the regression
of offspring trait values on the parent trait values with coefficient $\beta$,
we have that&lt;/p&gt;

The probability
that two lineages coalesce in generation $t$ in an idealized Wright-Fisher
population is given by&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;P_c(t) = \Big(\frac{1}{2n}\Big)\Big(1 - \frac{1}{2N}\Big)^{t-1}&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which defines a geometric distribution with ‘success’ probability $1/2N$. One
can derive a whole load of nice applied math from there on. A particularly nice
result is the mean time of coalescence of two lineages, which is by definition
of the mean&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\mathbb{E}(t_c(2)) = \sum_{t=1}^{\infty}tP_c(t)&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\sum_{t=0}^{\infty} x^k = \frac{1}{1-x}&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;is absolutely convergent for $|x| &amp;lt; 1$. This implies we can take the derivative&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which must equal $\frac{d}{dx}\frac{1}{1-x} = \frac{1}{(1-x)^2}$. So applying

&lt;p&gt;A bit of a recap is never a bad thing to do. So considering a locus with two alleles $p$ and $q$ in a finite diploid population of size $N$, initially at frequencies $q_0$ and $p_0$. Assuming an idealized population, following all Hardy-Weinberg conditions except the infinite population size, the expected frequency of $q_1$ is then $q_0$. The variance of this quantity can be calculated as a binomial sampling variance with sample size of $2N$ and is given by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\sigma^2_{q_1} = \frac{q_0 (1-q_0)}{2N}&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be interpreted as the variance in $q_1$ among different samples of size $N$ drawn from a base population with $q = q_0$. This is also the variance of the &lt;em&gt;change&lt;/em&gt; in allele frequency $\sigma^2_{\Delta q}$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can also consider &lt;strong&gt;genotype frequencies&lt;/strong&gt;, where the frequency of homozygotes in generation $t$ is of course given by $q_{t-1}^2$ and $p_{t-1}^2$. Consider the mean frequency of homozygotes among lines sampled from a base population with minor allele frequency $q_0$, which can be denoted $\overline{q^2}$. Recall that the expression for the variance of a random variable $X$ is given by $E(X^2) - E(X)^2$. Thus we have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;% &lt;![CDATA[
\begin{eqnarray}
\sigma^2_{q} &amp;=&amp; \overline{q^2} - \overline{q}^2 \\
\overline{q^2} &amp;=&amp; \overline{q}^2 + \sigma^2_{q}
\end{eqnarray} %]]&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consequences of this expression are clear. Indeed, $\overline{q}$ is just given by $q_0$, &lt;em&gt;i.e.&lt;/em&gt; the allele frequency in the base population. So the expected number of homozygotes $\overline{q^2}$ is always in excess over the original fraction of homozygotes $q_0^2$. Likewise, the fraction of heterozygotes is reduced by $2\sigma^2_{q}$. Note that we have not considered the process in function of time. We have just observed a snapshot situation in a finite population and have related it to the base population from which it was originally drawn. By doing this we observed that the fraction of homozygotes is increased with the variance of the allele frequency $\sigma_q^2$. How $\sigma_q^2$ evolves with time is something we will consider next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;inbreeding&quot;&gt;Inbreeding&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will now consider the famous coefficient of inbreeding, which is a measure of the dispersive process happening in finite populations. The coefficient of inbreeding $F$ is the probability that two alleles at a randomly sampled locus are &lt;em&gt;identical by descent&lt;/em&gt; (IBD). The average $F$ gives a measure of genetic drift in a population. Note that $F$ is only meaningful when compared to a base population!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering a base population with $2N$ genes which we consider all to be independent. We can easily see that $ F_1 = \frac{1}{2N} $. Similarly, we can reason that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;F_2 = \frac{1}{2N} + (1 - \frac{1}{2N})F_1&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gives a recursion for $F$. However this recursion is as such not very easy to work with. We can easily see that there is always an addition of $\frac{1}{2N}$ to the inbreeding coefficient in subsequent generations, originating from the probability to sample identical alleles in the base population. Call this $\Delta F = \frac{1}{2N}$. Now we can write the following expression&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;F_{t} = \Delta F + (1 -\Delta F)F_{t-1}&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which can be rearranged to give&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\Delta F = \frac{F_{t} - F_{t-1}}{1-F_{t-1}}&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which clearly shows the nature of $\Delta F$ as a measure for the rate of inbreeding. Indeed, it expresses the increase in the inbreeding coefficient normalized by the proportion of the population that was not yet inbred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now define the panmictic index $P_t = 1-F_t$ and we rearrange the last expression to give&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\frac{P_t}{P_{t-1}} = 1-\Delta F&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which gives rise to a lovely recursion rendering&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;% &lt;![CDATA[
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{P_t}{P_{t-2}} = \frac{P_t}{P_{t-1}} \frac{P_{t-1}}{P_{t-2}} &amp;=&amp; (1-\Delta F)^2 \\
&amp;\vdots&amp; \\
P_t &amp;=&amp; (1 - \Delta F)^t
\end{eqnarray} %]]&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which allows us to get a general expression for $F$ in function of $t$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;F_t = 1 - (1-\Delta F)^t&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which holds of course only when the F_0 is considered as 0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can now revisit the expressions in the previous sections which were attained by considering properties of binomial samples. We have shown that $\sigma_{\Delta q}^2 = \frac{q_0(1-q_0)}{2N}$ which we can now express as $q_0(1-q_0)\Delta F = q_0p_0\Delta F$. Similarly we can consider the variance in gene frequencies among different hypothetical lines of a same base population in any generation as $\sigma_{q,t}^2 = q_0p_0F_t$. Whereas $\Delta F$ can be regarded as the rate of new inbreeding, $F_t$ is a measure of the accumulated effect of random drift over $t$ generations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can again consider genotype frequencies. The mean fraction of homozygotes across hypothetical lines of size $2N$ of a same base population is still given by&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\overline{q^2} = \overline{q}^2 + \sigma_q^2&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where $\sigma_q^2$ can now be expressed in terms of the base population frequencies and the number of generations! Indeed, we have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\overline{q^2} = q_0^2 + q_0p_0F_t&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This clearly shows the cumulating excess of homozygotes through inbreeding. Similarly, we can consider the decline in the fraction heterozygotes ($H$). Given $H_0 = 2p_0q_0$ we can see that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;% &lt;![CDATA[
\begin{eqnarray}
H_t &amp;=&amp; 2p_0q_0 - 2q_0p_0F_t \\
    &amp;=&amp; 2p_0q_0(1-F_t) \\
    &amp;=&amp; H_0(1-F_t) = H_0P_t
\end{eqnarray} %]]&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;since the homozygote excess occurs at the expense of heterozygotes. Interestingly, this provides an interpretation for the panmictic index as the proportional decrease in the fraction of heterozygotes relative to the base population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is I think the core theory of inbreeding and basic population genetics in finite populations which one should always be able to reproduce on demand.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Finite idealized population</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Selection on a single diallelic locus</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/notes/popgen/evolution/2018/02/24/single_locus_selection.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Selection on a single diallelic locus" /><published>2018-02-24T16:04:50+01:00</published><updated>2018-02-24T16:04:50+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/notes/popgen/evolution/2018/02/24/single_locus_selection</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/notes/popgen/evolution/2018/02/24/single_locus_selection.html">&lt;p&gt;We consider the effect of selection on the allele frequency at a single locus. We restrict ourselves to the diallelic case. We denote the relative reproductive advantage of one genotype over another by the relative fitness $w$. These relative fitness derive from differential selection of genotypes, governed by some selection coefficient $s$. The basic formula for the allele frequency after one generation of selection is the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;p' = \frac{p^2 w_{AA} + p(1-p) w_{Aa}}{p^2 w_{AA} + 2p(1-p)w_{Aa} + (1-p)^2w_{aa}}&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;with $w$ the relative fitness for the genotype in subscript and $p$ the allele frequency of $A$. $p’$ denotes the allele frequency of $A$ in the next generation. The denominator ensures scaling to the novel population size obtained after selection. we further refer to it as the average fitness of the population $\bar{w}$. It is also useful to express the mean relative fitness of the allele $A$ as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\bar{w_{A}} = p w_{AA} + (1-p) w_{Aa}&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be interpreted as the average relative fitness of an individual, given that it received one $A$ allele from one parent (note the analogy with average effect in quantitative genetics).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can find the change in allele frequency due to selection as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;% &lt;![CDATA[
\begin{eqnarray}
\Delta p &amp;=&amp; p' - p  \\
         &amp;=&amp; \frac{p^2 w_{AA} + p(1-p) w_{Aa} - p\bar{w}}{\bar{w}}
         &amp;=&amp; \frac{p(\bar{w_A} - \bar{w})}{\bar{w}}
\end{eqnarray} %]]&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can use the above formulae to determine for example the change in allele frequency of a fully recessive allele $A$ with frequency $p$ and selection coefficient $s$. The average fitness of the allele is given by&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;% &lt;![CDATA[
\begin{eqnarray}
\bar{w_A} &amp;=&amp; p(1+s) + (1-p) \\

\end{eqnarray} %]]&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new allele frequency after one generation with selection is than given by&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resulting in a per generation change in allele frequency of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\Delta p = \frac{sp^2(1-p)}{1+sp^2}&lt;/script&gt;

Polyploidy was already for some time acknowledged as a feature of evolutionary interest in botany, but to my knowledge, Levin was the first to provide a (simple) mathematical description of the problem of cytotype coexistence. The model is inspired by population genetics, but instead of following alleles in a population, cytotypes (specifically diploids &amp;amp; tetraploids) are followed. Important to note is that Levin did not consider formation of tetraploids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Levin models two coexisting cytotypes which undergo random mating (with some degree of selfing). Inter-cytotype matings are assumed to lead to inviable and infertile offspring. In Levin’s model, the proportion of the two cytotypes are denoted as $p$ and $q$. The frequency of within-cytotype matings is given by $p^2$ for the first cytotype and $q^2$ for the second cytotype. The frequency of between-cytotype matings is of course $2pq$. To see the strong frequency dependent effect under this model, consider the proportion of failed matings for each cytotype, given by $\frac{2pq}{p} = 2q = 2(1-p)$ for the first cytotype and analogously by $2p$ for the second cytotype. The main observation is thus that &lt;em&gt;the proportion of failed matings increases for lower population sizes&lt;/em&gt;, which Levin called the minority cytotype disadvantage, leading to minority cytotype exclusion (MCE).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed after one generation, the frequency of the first cytotype is given by $p’ = \frac{p^2}{p^2 + q^2}$, giving a change in cytotype proportion of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;% &lt;![CDATA[

\Delta p &amp;=&amp; \frac{p^2}{p^2 + q^2} - p \\
         &amp;=&amp; \frac{p^2q - q^2p}{p^2 + q^2} \\
\end{eqnarray} %]]&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and likewise $ \Delta q = \frac{q^2p - p^2q}{p^2 + q^2} = -\Delta p $. This clearly shows how the minority cytotype disadvantage leads to minority cytotype exclusion. This is illustrated in the following plot:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Levin further incorporates selfing. With selfing probability $s$, the proportion of successful matings of course increases to $p^2(1-s) + ps$ (why not $p^2(1-s)^2 + ps$?). The above expressions can be adjusted for selfing as follows&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\Delta p = \frac{p^2(1-s) + ps}{p^2(1-s) + s + q^2(1-s)} - p&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think (note that $ps + qs = (p+q)s = s$).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">In his 1975 paper, Donald Levin proposed the first model of polyploid population establishment. Polyploidy was already for some time acknowledged as a feature of evolutionary interest in botany, but to my knowledge, Levin was the first to provide a (simple) mathematical description of the problem of cytotype coexistence. The model is inspired by population genetics, but instead of following alleles in a population, cytotypes (specifically diploids &amp;amp; tetraploids) are followed. Important to note is that Levin did not consider formation of tetraploids.</summary></entry></feed>
