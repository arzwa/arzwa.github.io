<p>I have written about the underlying generative model, which is based on multiple sequence alignments of sets of evolutionary related genes (better known as <em>gene families</em>), before and will not reiterate these technical details here. I include the accompanying note for the exhibition here and point to my bandcamp page for the actual music.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This music was generated based on sets of evolutionary related gene sequences across different plant species. This synthetic result was merged with field recordings made on travels during the summers of 2016 and 2017 to form an organic whole. The music embodies the paradoxical goal of purposelessness. It evokes tranquility and peaceful indifference.</p>
