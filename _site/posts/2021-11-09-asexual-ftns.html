        <p>We derive a form of the fundamental theorem of natural selection (FTNS) for
asexual organisms. Fisher’s FTNS, which is not <em>that</em> fundamental, says that,
for a population consisting of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> types with constant relative fitnesses and
no mutation, (1) mean fitness is non-decreasing and (2) increases at a rate
proportional to the genetic variance in fitness (is this in fact what
<em>Fisher</em>’s version says?). We will here further assume generations are
non-overlapping and that there is asexual reproduction.</p>
<p>We refer to the expected number of offspring individuals of an individual of
type <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> as the <em>fitness</em> of type <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. Let the fitnesses for the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> types be
<span class="math inline">\(w_1, w_2, \dots, w_n\)</span> and let <span class="math inline">\(n_1(t), \dots, n_i(t)\)</span> be the number of
individuals of each type in generation <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(N(t) = \sum_i n_i(t)\)</span> the
total population size. The type frequencies are denoted by <span class="math inline">\(p_i = n_i / N\)</span>.
Note that types could be alleles in haploids, genotypes in diploids and
polyploids, or something else, the only assumption at present being that there
is no recombination or mutation, so that types are faithfully inherited. Our
goal is to find a solution for the change in mean fitness over time when
fitnesses are constant. We will have three steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>We first find a recursion for the (geno)type frequencies. We have
<span class="math display">\[\Delta p_i = p_i' - p_i 
= \frac{w_i n_i}{\sum_j n_j w_j} - p_i 
= \frac{p_i (w_i - \bar{w})}{\bar{w}}\]</span>
Where <span class="math inline">\(\bar{w} = \mathbb{E}[w] = \sum_j w_j p_j\)</span> is the mean fitness. This
also holds when fitnesses are time-dependent (in which case we would
write <span class="math inline">\(w_i(t)\)</span>).</p></li>
<li><p>Now we find a recursion for mean fitness, we have
<span class="math display">\[\Delta \bar{w} = \bar{w^\prime} - \bar{w} = \sum_i (w_i'p_i' - w_i p_i)\]</span>
The goal now is to partition the change in mean fitness in a part due
to evolutionary change, and a part due to changes in fitness over
time. We can accomplish this by noting that
<span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
\Delta \bar{w} &amp;= \sum_i ((w_i + \Delta w_i)p_i' - w_ip_i) \\
&amp;= \sum_i \Delta w_i p_i' + \sum_i \Delta p_i w_i \\
&amp;= \mathbb{E}[\Delta w] + \sum_i \Delta p_i w_i
\end{align*}
\]</span>
This shows that the change in mean fitness is equal to the mean of the
fitness changes and a component from evolutionary change (i.e. change
in genotype frequencies).</p></li>
<li><p>We now plug our result from (1) in (2) to find
<span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
\Delta \bar{w} &amp;= 
\mathbb{E}[\Delta w] + \frac{1}{\bar{w}}\sum_i p_i w_i (w_i - \bar{w}) \\
&amp;= \mathbb{E}[\Delta w] + \frac{1}{\bar{w}}(\sum_i w_i^2 p_i -
\bar{w}\sum_i w_i p_i) \\
&amp;= \mathbb{E}[\Delta w] + \frac{\mathbb{V}(w)}{\bar{w}}
\end{align*}
\]</span>
Which is our desired result. Since the variance <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{V}(w)\)</span> is
non-negative, we have that, when relative fitnesses are constant so
that <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{E}[\Delta w] = 0\)</span>, mean fitness is non-decreasing. Furthermore,
mean fitness increases at a rate proportional to the genetic variance
in fitness.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Some additional remarks.</strong>
We note that in the above, genotype frequencies <span class="math inline">\(p_i\)</span> and changes
therein only depend on ratio’s of fitnesses of the form <span class="math inline">\(w_i/\bar{w}\)</span>,
and not on absolute fitnesses, so we can always scale fitnesses when
dealing with genotype frequencies (and not absolute numbers of each
type in the population).
We can decompose (absolute) fitness in a viability and fertility
component. Viability <span class="math inline">\(v_i\)</span> will be the probability that an individual
of genotype <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> reaches reproductive age. Fertility <span class="math inline">\(f_i\)</span> will be the
expected number of offspring from a type <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> adult. We then have <span class="math inline">\(w_i = v_i f_i\)</span>, i.e. formally fitness (the expected contribution of an
individual of type <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> to the next generation) is given by the law of
total expectation as
<span class="math display">\[\mathbb{E}[\text{#offspring}_i]=\mathbb{E}[\mathbb{E}[\text{#offspring}_i|\text{survival}_i]]
= f_i v_i\]</span>
Assume that <span class="math inline">\(w_1 &gt; w_i\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(i &gt; 1\)</span>. We then always have <span class="math inline">\(\bar{w} \le w_1\)</span> and it can be seen that, when we assume constant fitnesses
<span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
p_1 &amp;\rightarrow 1 \\
\bar{w} &amp;\rightarrow w_1 \\
\mathbb{V}(w) &amp;\rightarrow 0 
\end{align*}
\]</span>
During evolution, the quantity <span class="math inline">\((w_1 - \bar{w})/w_1 = 1 - \bar{w}/w_1\)</span>
is minimized. This quantity is the <em>relative reproductive excess</em> of
genotype 1. With pure viability selection (i.e. all <span class="math inline">\(f_i = f\)</span>),
<span class="math inline">\(\bar{w}/w_1\)</span> can be interpreted as the relative survival probability
of a random individual compared to the most fit genotype, and
the reproductive excess <span class="math inline">\(1-\bar{w}/w_1\)</span> can be interpreted as the
relative amount of selective mortality in the population compared to
the most fit genotype. This quantity is known as the <em>genetic load</em>.</p>
