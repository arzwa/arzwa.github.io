<blockquote>
<p>“No one likes to come down from the top of a tall building, from where visas
and panoramas are visible, and inspect a window-less basement. We know,
intellectually, that there could be no panoramas without the basement, but
emotionally, we feel no desire to look at it directly; indeed we feel an
aversion. Above all, there is no beauty; there are only dark corners and
dampness and airlessness. It is sufficient to know that the building stands on
it, that its supports, its pipes, and plumbing are in place and functioning.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A rather typical Rosennian passage, with a tinge of psychoanalysis of the
scientist, an explicit allusion to aesthetic qualities of science. I am unsure
whether he is honest about the ‘No one’ (understanding ‘We’ to refer, roughly,
to ‘We scientists’, conceived rather broadly) or whether he is being
ironic – perhaps even slightly sardonic.</p>
<p>At any rate,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Rosen_(biologist)">Robert Rosen</a> puts
epistemological issues rightly at the heart of science, and has some ideas
there that I find highly appealing.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
These ideas revolve around two concepts: (1) <em>Natural Law</em> and (2) <em>Modeling
Relations</em>.</p>
