I am currently a PhD student in the group of professor [Yves Van de
Peer](https://www.vandepeerlab.org/), conducting research on the
evolutionary importance of polyploidy. In practice I have mainly
worked on statistical phylogenetic methods for the inference of genome
duplications from comparative genomic data and modeling of gene family
evolution, where I have come to prefer a Bayesian approach towards
statistics. More broadly, I'd say I am interested in theoretical
biology and statistics. Besides my aspirations in science, I take a
strong interest in philosophy, music and literature. I enjoy computer
programming, playing music, long(ish)-distance running and traveling
by bicycle.
