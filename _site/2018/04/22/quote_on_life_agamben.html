<p>How can we make biological sense of such an account of <em>life</em>? Life as an immanent, inexhaustible potentiality. Can such an account of life be relevant for plant or bacterial life? The tautology that living things <em>live</em> enforces the requirement of an account of the verb <em>live</em>, the verb that according to Agamben takes no other object than <em>life itself</em>. To live is to be life, is to be the potentiality that is referred to by Agamben and Aristotle.</p>

<p>Is this contemporary science (physics-dominated) and life in disguise?</p>
