    album: Für Alina
    year: 1999
    img: img/ArvoPart_1999.jpg
    genre: classical, 	minimalism
    content: Multiple recordings of two compositions  by Arvo Part are featured on this reease. Spiegel in Spiegel may be the  best sleeping track for some, but I prefer Fur Alina. The mesmerizing  tintinnabuli score keeps fascinating as well as sleep inducing. I remember,  before knowing the score by heart that the music sometimes feels as if some  short lines are popping up and fading away circularly. A tremendous  reccomendation, also for non-classical music enthousiasts.

Sweet and soft ambient pop music from Reykjavik musicians Alex Somers and  Scott Alario. Note that it is a very short album but nevertheless chances  are high you'll be in dreamland before you reach the last track.

    year: 2012

    genre: digital 		minimalism, ambient, electronic.
    content: Incessant subtle noise fills the space, while   sunlight enters through the large window and illuminates the grey, but   complex textured wall. It is a music that fits the room, and induces   the occasional hypnoticizing synaesthetic feeling. Texture, an   inherently synaesthetic term when applied to music, is what this music   is about. The subtle field recordings document insignificant sounds,   that are easily neglected in everyday life, however become all the more   enjoyable submerged in the organic drones of this music.

  - artist: Asher
    album: Landscape Studies
    year: 2009
    img: img/asher_landscape.jpg
    genre: ambient, drone
    content: A point of rest, a subtle but rich landscape or a   miniature. A close up of an at first glance uninteresting artefact.   These high notes dive in the lonesome and calming grey winter evening.   It's rare, a music for a scene as grey and dark as the album cover that   is yet so comforting.  Never have I appreciated electronic monotonous   noise more than in the subtle washes of these landscape studies.

    img: img/wickhamsmith.png
    genre: opera, experimental, electronic
    content: That which causes direct insight. Emptiness   assuming loverizes to rible the perfect forest of glue testamen, a   collection of lotus flowers a mixture of five kinds of degeneration   runs to hide at the far end of the dharma ocean, there is no rest for   the holy bees who have experienced the glorious taste of the honey.   When we arrived at the goddess, the goddess clarified the teaching for   us, explaining it in detail from the bottom up. I was standing amidst a   group of monks when the oracle singled me out.  A ritual dagger.  A   highly exceptional music.

    genre: classic 		ambient
    content: Lux is not only   light, but also lightness. Floating music for slow mornings with some   nice coffee. Some ethereal strings and a parsimonious looping and   dwelling synth constitute this lovely easy flowing wallpaper music. As   the morning sun illuminates the room, and Lux 1 is filling this tiny   corner of the universe, everything seems just right.

    year: 2006
    img: img/RobertHenke_2006.jpg
    genre: ambient, drone, electronic
    content: A phenomenal listening experience, otherworldly drones from a bunch of 'Buddha machines'.  Henke - The FM3 Buddha Machine is a low-fi loop playing device containing nine pre-recorded loops which cannot be changed by the user. Due to manufacturing imperfections, individual machines play the loops with a slightly different sound, pitch and duration. The built-in playbackcircuit, with its low sampling rate and bit resolution, produces a very rough sound, similar to ancient computer games or talking toys. Rich, spacious textures and moving echoes occur when many of these machines are played at the same time.

Free jazz  can be frightening, however, some free jazz records can even convince the  frightened listener upon careful examination. Coltrane's Ascension is such  an album, full of rich dynamics and expressionist solo's, it strikes me  every time. Also very attractive cover art in my opinion

    content: Wonderful work from the german composer-pianist Hans Otte.  It feels   like a thorough study of the mesmerizing qualities of tonal minimalism.   Reiteration of well-sounding patterns, without the kitch or   tiresomeness of many inferior attempts. What is the book? Where did it   come from? Did Otte write/read/heared it?  Do we hear it? Which sounds?   All sounds? Only patterns of sounds?

    content: One of the first long (~1 hour) ambient jams, a   genre that will forever exert a huge attraction on me. Thursday   afternoon provides so explicity what I search in ambient music, some   sort of hard to characterize room filling atmospheric calmness,   inducing a comforting and friendly feeling. The free flowing looping   synth floats on a layer of incessant ethereal drones, which sometimes   disappears in the background, and sometimes is prominently present.

    album: The Disintegration Loops
    year: 2000
    img: img/WilliamBasinski_2000.jpg
    genre: ambient
    content: The Disintegration Loops, was  created out of tape loops Basinski made back in the early 1980s. These  loops held some personal significance to Basinski, a significance he only  touches on in the liner notes and we can only guess at. The tapes were old  and were disintegrating as they played and he recorded them. As he notes in  the liner notes, 'The music was dying.' But he kept recording, documenting  the death of these loops. Basinski lives in Brooklyn, less than a nautical  mile from the World Trade Centers. On September 11, 2001, as he was  completing The Disintegration Loops, he watched these towers disintegrate.  He and his friends went on the roof of his building and played the Loops  over and over, all day long, watching the slow death of one New York and  the slow rise of another, all the while listening to the death of one music  and the creation of another. The rest is history.

    content: The sinking of the Titanic is maybe  the seminal work of Gavin Bryars. A wonderful orchestral piece with strong  influences from minimal and ambient music, yet retaining a classical  orchestral atmosphere. The slow string movements combined with the  suggestion of a sinking ship give a strange soothing feel. The B-side  contains the mesmerizing piece 'Jesus' blood never failed me yet',  consisting of a looping recording of an old british homeless poor man,  expressing his faith in the divine grace with an almost enlightened aura.  It is a simple, yet one of the most wonderful pieces ever made.

Andrew Lee, who so devotedly directs his   pianism to the wonderful tonal minimal works and does not recoil for   this 4 hour piece. Also the label, Irritable hedgehog should be thanked   for their wonderful contributions to my collection. November is the  quintessential minimal piano music, a music that induces a  certain state of disillusioning calm, a waking-up alone after a  night of rain.
