**Arthur Zwaenepoel** (Gent °1995)

![](img/auv1.jpg){width=100%} 

I am currently a PhD student in the group of professor [Yves Van de
Peer](https://www.vandepeerlab.org/), conducting research on the evolutionary
importance of polyploidy. In practice I have mainly worked on statistical
phylogenetic methods for the inference of genome duplications from comparative
genomic data and modeling of gene family evolution, where I have come to prefer
a Bayesian approach towards statistics. More broadly, my main research
interests are (theoretical) evolutionary genetics and probabilistic modeling in
biology. Besides my aspirations in science, I take a strong interest in
philosophy, music and literature. I enjoy computer programming, playing music,
long(ish)-distance running and traveling by bicycle.
