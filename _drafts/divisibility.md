title: Divisibility
---

While reading both Rosen and Bergson, I came to (try to) think a lot about
(in)divisibility, continuity, reccurrence, time, *etc.* and their vague
relations. I wonder what I can say about these things, would I have something
meaningful to write down on these matters?

It seems that all science regards the paradoxes of Zeno as unproblematic, 
we can see two lines crossing when plotting $y = x + 1$ and $y = 2x$, and 
take no issue with the relationships between points on these lines and 
the lines themselves, a sphere where the infinite lurks. Yet, we do assume
Achilles and the Tortoise their paths have properties of both, they are
at any time at some definite point (= dimensionless) along their trajectories 
but they can cross as any two non-parallel lines in the euclidean plane do.
Nevertheless, to do so Achilles must traverse an infinite number of these 
points. Trouble with these paradoxes seems to persist.

The probability of a single event from a continuous distribution is 0. Any
actual event is therefore a mirical, unless the continuous is just some formal
convenience, and models a discrete probability density of unconceivable fine
grainedness. So this is one option, the continuous as a model for the discrete,
a view that science seems to suggest (I am thinking of QM for example). [How
does this model work? Rosen...]

Bergson would disagree, the continuous is reality, duration
