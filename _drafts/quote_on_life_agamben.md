title:  "Vivere vitam"
---

>The Latins had a singular expression, vivere vitam, which was passed on to modern romance languages as vivre sa vie, vivere la propria vita. The full transitive force of the verb ‘vivere’ has to be restored here; a force, however that does not take on an object (this is the paradox!), but, so to speak, has no object other than life itself. Life here is a possibility, a potentiality that never exhausts itself in biographical facts and events, since it has no object other than itself. It is an absolute immanence that nevertheless moves and lives. - Giorgio Agamben - quoted in [Vincenzo Di Nicola - Take your time: the seven pillars of a Slow Thought manifesto](https://aeon.co/essays/take-your-time-the-seven-pillars-of-a-slow-thought-manifesto)

How can we make biological sense of such an account of *life*? Life as an immanent, inexhaustible potentiality. Can such an account of life be relevant for plant or bacterial life? The tautology that living things *live* enforces the requirement of an account of the verb *live*, the verb that according to Agamben takes no other object than *life itself*. To live is to be life, is to be the potentiality that is referred to by Agamben and Aristotle.

>Harmony, so-called, is a forced abstract vertical relation which blots out the spontaneous transmitting nature of each of the sounds forced into it. It is artificial and unrealistic. [John Cage - 45' For a Speaker]()

Is this contemporary science (physics-dominated) and life in disguise?
