Let $\mathcal{G}$ be the category of reconciled gene trees $G$ for a given species tree $S$. A reconciled tree can be defined as in Arvestad *et al.* (2009). We define $hom_{\mathcal{G}}$ as the set of morphisms $f: G_1 \rightarrow G_2$ between two such reconciled trees. This set can be partitioned into two kinds of morphisms, either relabeling the vertices of $G_1$ or rearranging the topology of $G_1$. All morphisms in $\mathcal{G}$ preserve the leaf labeling $\sigma: L(G) \rightarrow L(S)$.
