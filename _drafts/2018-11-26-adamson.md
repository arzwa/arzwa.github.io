>As Bergson has demonstrated, in order to distance ourselves from the objective
>world as well as to perceive aspects of it, consciousness does not 'add'
>anything to the real, but substracts that which is of no interest (p. 20).

>[...] The instant conditions scientific thought and representation in its 
>entirety, introducing a Platonism into science which is, as Bergson writes, 
>'immanent to the method'. (p. 40)
