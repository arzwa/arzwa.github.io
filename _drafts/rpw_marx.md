## Lecture 4

Commodity as a central object in the mystifications of capitalism. A quasi-
religous object.

Mystifications of commodity exchange:

- **First mystification:** a commodity is a quantity of embodied labour.  Equal
  amounts of embodied labour exchange in the market place. the accidents of the
commodity change but te substance remains the same , i.e.  embodied labour.
This is mysterious as it is a form of inverted trnssubstantiation (cfr.
Christianity)

- **Second mystification:** embodied labour is some quantity of 'abstract
  socially necessary labour'. Which is an absurd notion. 

- **Third mystification:** the mystification of the factory and the
  marketplace.  The marketplace is the realm of appearance, the factory is the
real world, where profit is made. The reality of capitalism is in the dark
factories, where profit is made. The exact inversion of the allegory of the
cave of Plato.

- **Fourth mystification:** the problem is "where does profit come from?" How
  does the capitalist gets rich, if everything is sold at its labour value (~
Ricardo's theory of labour value i.e. equals for equals).

## Lecture 5

Although the central categories of capitalism are absurd and crazy, they are 
socially valid. The society *validates* it.
