title:  Aristotelian causality in relational biology
---

It's kind of cool how Robert Rosen, with his vast intellectual baggage, reinvigorated Aristotelian causal terms in science. I myself think this might be a worthy endeavor, as framing scientific questions in terms of Aristotelian causality entails1 as a somewhat more involved relationship with the object of interest. Aristotle actually asks "why?", indeed, "Understanding, is to grasp the 'Why' of a thing". Science has however evolved towards a state where we are focused on but the 'what' and the 'how' of things, or in Aristotelian terms, the material and efficient causes.

A very remarkable use of Aristotelian causal terms in Rosen's relational biology is in the statement "Organisms are closed to efficient causation". The attractiveness of this way of talking is the introduction of notions of causality in mathematical descriptions of systems. "Closed to" refers to a mathematical notion of set operations. A set is for example closed under addition if any sum of two elements in the set is an element of the set (the Natural numbers for example). Or as another example, a set can be closed under countable unions, that is any sequence of unions of elements is itself an element of the set. So what does Rosen mean with "closed to efficient causation"? How does it relate with Aristotelian efficient causation?
