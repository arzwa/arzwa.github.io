title: The mean time of coalescence

So yeah, we know the basic coalescent is fairly easy to grasp. The probability
that two lineages coalesce in generation $t$ in an idealized Wright-Fisher
population is given by

$$ P_c(t) = \Big(\frac{1}{2n}\Big)\Big(1 - \frac{1}{2N}\Big)^{t-1} $$

which defines a geometric distribution with 'success' probability $1/2N$. One
can derive a whole load of nice applied math from there on. A particularly nice
result is the mean time of coalescence of two lineages, which is by definition
of the mean

$$ \mathbb{E}(t_c(2)) = \sum_{t=1}^{\infty}tP_c(t) $$

and then they say that this is $2N$, but why? Well, we know that the series 

$$ \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} x^k = \frac{1}{1-x} $$

is absolutely convergent for $\|x\| < 1$. This implies we can take the derivative

$$\begin{eqnarray} 
\frac{d}{dx}\sum_{t=0}^{\infty} x^t &=& \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \frac{dx^t}{dx} \\ 
                                    &=& \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} tx^{t-1} 
\end{eqnarray}$$

which must equal $\frac{d}{dx}\frac{1}{1-x} = \frac{1}{(1-x)^2}$. So applying
this to our case where $x = (1-1/2N)$ we have

$$\begin{eqnarray} 
\mathbb{E}(t_c(2)) &=& \sum_{t=1}^{\infty}t \frac{1}{2N} \Big(1 - \frac{1}{2N}\Big)^{t-1} \\ 
                   &=& \frac{1}{2N} \sum_{t=1}^{\infty} t \Big(1 - \frac{1}{2N}\Big)^{t-1} \\ 
                   &=& \frac{1}{2N} \Bigg(\frac{1}{(1-1+\frac{1}{2N})^2}\Bigg) \\ 
                   &=& 2N 
\end{eqnarray}$$

which is neat.
