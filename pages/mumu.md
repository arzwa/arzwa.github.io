## Ryoko Akama - Dial 45-21-95
![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/0017729702_10.jpg) The Another Timbre record
label has been a great discovery for me. This somewhat Wandelweiser-ish album
with music from [Ryoko
Akama](https://anothertimbre.bandcamp.com/album/dial-45-21-95) I,
unsurprisingly, like a lot. There is something in the track titles that makes
the whole record resonate as something grounded in humble everyday life.

## DJ Olive - Listening to Fir
![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/0013583785_10.jpg) [A great record by DJ
Olive](https://reservematinee.bandcamp.com/album/listening-to-fir) I somehow
missed. I must have slept hundreds of times to his Sleep, Buoy and Triage
albums, and discovering there is something left to discover is a very pleasant
surprise.
