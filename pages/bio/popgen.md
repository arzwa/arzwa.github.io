title: Population genetics self study
---

## Things I have studied so far

1. Infinite populations (deterministic population genetics)
    - Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium
    - Mutation and selection in large random mating population
    - Island model of migration
2. Finite populations (stochastic treatment)
    - Markov model of random genetic drift with selection (M. Nei)
    - Inbreeding and $F$-statistics
    - The coalescent process

## Things I definitely want to study

1. Diffusion approximations (see Ewens)
2. The fundamental theorem of natural selection (see Ewens)
3. Phenotypic evolution models (Lande *etc.*?)
