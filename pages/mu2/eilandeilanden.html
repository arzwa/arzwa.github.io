    </a>
    The debut album eilandeilanden by eilandeilanden. A highly premature release.
    Imagine yourself very remotely on a sunny island surrounded by friendly bureaucrats, having very strange mutual
    relationships. Imagine yourself on a journey where you are submerged in relaxing awkwardness. Imagine yourself
    in that workshop you really find useless, but you had to go, in a way that you enjoy every piece of it, despite
    the atmosphere of painful silence-based awkwardness. Imagine yourself on the eilandeilanden, a holiday destination
    without escape possibilities. This is eilandeilanden.
