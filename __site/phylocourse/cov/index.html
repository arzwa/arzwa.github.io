<p>In this exercise we will take a look at the origins of SARS-CoV-2 – the virus causing Covid-19 – by means of phylogenetic analysis. As is well-known, SARS-CoV-2 is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoonosis">zoonotic</a> pathogen, meaning it jumped from some other species, which may act as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_reservoir">reservoir</a>, to a human host. Many important viral pathogens are zoonotic &#40;e.g. SARS, MERS, Ebola, HIV, ...&#41; and there is an obvious interest in identifying potentially zoonotic lineages and their reservoirs.</p>
<p>SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the Sarbecovirus clade within Coronaviridae. It was early on found to be relatively closely related to a sarbecovirus from Horseshoe bats, RaTG13, and later also viral isolates from pangolins were suggested as potential close relatives. Sarbecoviruses are, unlike many other RNA viruses, undergoing quite a lot of recombination, which makes phylogenetic inference challenging. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-0771-4">Boni <em>et al.</em></a> identified non-recombining regions &#40;NRR&#41; and conducted phylogenetic analyses using those. </p>
<p>We will use the data from Boni <em>et al.</em>, which can be obtained from <a href="https://github.com/plemey/SARSCoV2origins">this Github repository</a>. </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Infer a tree using maximum likelihood inference for the &#39;sarbecovirus&#39; data set &#40;either their NRR1, NRR2 or NRA3 data sets&#41;. Which model assumptions will you use? </p>
</li>
<li><p>Assess the tree you found, what is your hypothesis on the zoonotic origins of SARS-CoV-2?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Why is recombination a problem for standard phylogenetic inference? Which assumption&#40;s&#41; can it possibly violate?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Why haven&#39;t we cared much about recombination in previous exercises? Should we have?</p>
</li>
</ol>
