<h1 id="sars-cov-2_origins"><a href="#sars-cov-2_origins" class="header-anchor">SARS-CoV-2 origins</a></h1>
<p>In this exercise we will take a look at the origins of SARS-CoV-2 – the virus causing Covid-19 – by means of phylogenetic analysis. It is widely believed to be of zoonotic origin like other major viral outbreaks &#40;SARS, MERS, Ebola, HIV&#41;,  although a lab origin is as far as I know not disproved<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fndef:1" class="fnref">[1]</a></sup>. </p>
<p>SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the Sarbecovirus clade within Coronaviridae. It was early on found to be relatively closely related to a sarbecovirus from Horseshoe bats, RaTG13, and later also viral isolates from pangolins were suggested as potential close relatives. Sarbecoviruses are, unlike many other RNA viruses, undergoing quite a lot of recombination, which makes phylogenetic inference challenging. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-0771-4">Boni <em>et al.</em></a> identified non-recombining regions &#40;NRR&#41; and conducted phylogenetic analyses using those. </p>
<p>We will use the data from Boni <em>et al.</em>, which can be obtained from <a href="https://github.com/plemey/SARSCoV2origins">this Github repository</a>. </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Infer a tree using maximum likelihood inference for the &#39;sarbecovirus&#39; data set &#40;either their NRR1, NRR2 or NRA3 data sets&#41;. Which model assumptions will you use? </p>
</li>
<li><p>Assess the tree you found, what is your hypothesis on the zoonotic origins of SARS-CoV-2? Could this disprove the hypothesis that the pandemic derives from a lab strain?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Why is recombination a problem for standard phylogenetic inference? Which assumption&#40;s&#41; can it possibly violate?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Why haven&#39;t we cared much about recombination in previous exercises? Should we have?</p>
</li>
</ol>

        <td class="fndef-content">I believe it is currently not possible to rule out either hypothesis, although much of the scientific community does seem to rule out the lab-origin theory. See for instance <a href="https://thebulletin.org/2021/05/the-origin-of-covid-did-people-or-nature-open-pandoras-box-at-wuhan/">this article</a> for some of the reasons why the matter is complicated &#40;politically, scientifically, biologically&#41;.</td>
