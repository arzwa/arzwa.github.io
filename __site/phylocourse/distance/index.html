<p>Distance-based phylogenetic methods proceed by computing a <strong>pairwise distance matrix</strong> for an input alignment based on a <a href="../submod">substitution model</a>, i.e. an assumed <strong>model of evolution</strong> for molecular sequences. Usually these estimated distances are the maximum likelihood estimates &#40;MLE&#41; of the pairwise distance under the assumed substitution model. For instance, consider two sequences, for an observed proportion of different sites \(x\), the maximum likelihood estimate of the distance between the two sequences under the Jukes &amp; Cantor substitution model is</p>
\[\hat{d} = -\frac{3}{4} \log \Big(1 - \frac{4}{3}x\Big)\]
<p>So for instance for the alignment</p>
<pre><code class="language-julia">seqa &#61; &quot;ATCGGGCTAGC&quot;
seqb &#61; &quot;TTCGGCTTACC&quot;;</code></pre>
<p>The proportion of different sites is</p>
<pre><code class="language-julia">differences &#61; &#91;seqa&#91;i&#93; &#33;&#61; seqb&#91;i&#93; for i&#61;1:length&#40;seqa&#41;&#93;
@show differences
num_differences &#61; sum&#40;differences&#41;
x &#61; num_differences/length&#40;seqa&#41;</code></pre><pre><code class="plaintext">differences = Bool[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]
0.36363636363636365</code></pre>
<p>The estimated distance is</p>
<pre><code class="language-julia">d &#61; -0.75 * log&#40;1. - 4x/3&#41;</code></pre><pre><code class="plaintext">0.49747066305769816</code></pre>
<p>This distance is correctly interpreted as <strong>an estimate of the expected number of substitutions per site</strong> separating the two sequences. Note that the distance is a product of two other evolutionary variables: the <strong>substitution rate</strong> and the <strong>divergence time</strong>. If we have \(n\) sequences, we can apply the distance formula to obtain an \(n \times n\)  <strong>distance matrix</strong>. Note however that such simple distance formulae are generally not available for more complicated substitution models. For more details, see the <a href="../submod">notes on substitution models</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Question &#40;optional&#41;</strong>. The proportion of different sites in a pair of sequence \(x\) is a <strong>summary statistic</strong> of the data, we reduce the data to a single number \(x\). For the Jukes - Cantor model the likelihood \(P(\text{sequence pair}|\mathrm{model})\) only depends on the summary statistic \(x\). Why will such a summary statistic not work for more complicated substitution models, for instance where transitions and transversions have different rates? If we cannot use a formula based on some summary statistic, how can we estimate a distance?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After computing the distance matrix, a tree is inferred by using some sort of clustering algorithm or least-squares estimation step. Distance-based phylogenetic inference is thus essentially a two-step process:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Compute pairwise distances</p>
</li>
<li><p>Infer the tree, assuming the distances</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This two-step procedure is both the strength and weakness of distance-based methods. By collapsing the sequence data with \(n\) sequences into a single \(n
\times n\) matrix we dramatically reduce the data, making tree inference computationally very fast. However, by reducing the rich sequence data to such a matrix we risk throwing away a lot of potentially interesting evolutionary information. Indeed, if we have \(n\) sequences, there are \(4^n\) nucleotide patterns for any site when we compare all \(n\) sequences, which we reduce to \(n(n-1)/2\) when using methods based on pairwise distances. This is different from full maximum-likelihood tree inference methods, where all possible higher-order &#40;higher than pairwise that is&#41; character patterns contribute to phylogeny inference. One can think of the approach of phylogeny estimation from pairwise distances as follows: each distance is an estimate of the branch length between two sequences in the phylogeny, and we seek the phylogeny that is most compatible with these independently obtained branch length estimates. In other words, we estimate \(n(n-1)/2\) two-species phylogenies and seek to somehow infer the phylogeny for all \(n\) sequences from those two-species phylogenies.</p>
<p>Another issue is that when using distance-based methods the estimated distances from step 1 <em>are treated as observed data</em> in step 2. However, distances are themselves estimates, associated with some uncertainty &#40;a distance estimate has a variance for instance&#41;, and this uncertainty in the estimated distances is neglected in step 2. This is a common source of issues in many areas of bioinformatics, i.e. treating estimates as data, as if known without error &#40;the multiple sequence alignments we use to infer phylogenies provide a good example&#33;&#41;.</p>
<p>Both of these issues are solved in ML and Bayesian phylogenetic inference, however at the price of a strongly increased computational cost. Because of their speed and relatively good performance, distance methods are still quite often used, even in this age of highly performant computers. Some popular ML tree inference programs &#40;for instance IQ-TREE, see the ML tutorial&#41; start their tree search algorithm from a distance-based tree for instance. Also popular packages for phylogenomic and comparative genomic inference such as <a href="https://github.com/davidemms/OrthoFinder">OrthoFinder</a> use distance-based phylogenetic methods in their workflow.</p>

<p>While you could easily implement a little program to generate a distance matrix under the Jukes and Cantor model &#40;see the formulae for the distance in the section on <a href="../submod">substitution models</a>&#41;, this is less straightforward when employing more complicated substitution models. FastME is probably the fastest implementation of distance-based phylogenetics methods using general substitution models available today. It is a software tool that can both be used to estimate distance matrices and infer trees using <strong>Neighbor-Joining</strong>, <strong>least-squares</strong>, <strong>minimum evolution</strong> and related distance matrix based methods.</p>
<p>There are two ways to run FastME. There is an interactive mode &#40;inherited from the influential <a href="http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html">PHYLIP software package</a>&#41; and a command line mode. Here I will use the command line mode, but feel free to use the interactive mode.  First get a look at the help message</p>
<pre><code class="language-julia">fastme -help</code></pre>
<p>If you have read the course notes from prof. Van de Peer, most of the options listed there &#40;but not all, no worries&#41; should make some sense to you. To infer a distance matrix with the Jukes &amp; Cantor model you can run something like this from the command line<sup id="fnref:commandline"><a href="#fndef:commandline" class="fnref">[3]</a></sup> :</p>
<pre><code class="language-julia">fastme -i 18SrRNA_20.phy -O 18SrRNA_20_JCmatrix.txt -dJC69</code></pre>
<p>Try to run this command and see whether you manage to make it work. The above command should generate a distance matrix. Take a look at the file <code>18SrRNA_20.phy_fastme_stat.txt</code>, is everything as expected?</p>
<p>Let&#39;s make a heatmap to visualize the distance matrix:</p>
<pre><code class="language-julia">using Plots
function readmatrix&#40;file&#41;  # little function to read the FastME distance matrix
    lines &#61; &#91;split&#40;l&#41; for l in readlines&#40;file&#41;&#91;2:end&#93; if l &#33;&#61; &quot;&quot;&#93;

    names &#61; &#91;l&#91;1&#93; for l in lines&#93;
    matrix, names, length&#40;names&#41;
end

<p><img src="/assets/phylocourse/distance/hm1.svg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Something similar can be done in any other programming language. For instance in <code>R</code> the following should work:</p>
<pre><code class="language-R">X &#61; read.table&#40;&quot;./18SrRNA_20_JCmatrix.txt&quot;, skip&#61;1&#41;

X &#61; as.matrix&#40;X&#91;,2:ncol&#40;X&#41;&#93;&#41;  # remove the row names, and convert to a numeric matrix
heatmap&#40;X&#41;</code></pre>

<h2 id="clustering_methods"><a href="#clustering_methods" class="header-anchor">Clustering methods</a></h2>
<p><strong>Clustering methods</strong> in distance-based phylogenetics are not different from hierarchical clustering methods used in other applications, such as unsupervised machine learning for instance. Both the UPGMA and WPGMA clustering methods are specific cases of <em>average linkage clustering</em> &#40;with different formula&#39;s used to compute the distance between two already existing clusters&#41;. Clustering methods can be found in many packages for scientific computing for most programming languages &#40;here I&#39;ll use the <code>Clustering.jl</code> package for the julia progamming language, note that average linkage clustering as it is usually implemented is identical to what is called the WPGMA method in phylogenetics &#40;see p.16 &amp; 17 in prof. Van de Peer&#39;s course notes&#41;.</p>

<p>Neighbor-joining &#40;NJ&#41; is another method for distance-based phylogenetics. It is also a clustering method, but one that does not produce ultrametric trees. NJ and its variants are implemented in FastME. To run tree inference with NJ for an input alignment or distance matrix, run <code>fastme</code> with the <code>-o
&lt;output_file&gt;</code> and <code>-m NJ</code> options. For instance</p>
<pre><code class="language-julia">fastme -i 18SrRNA_20.phy -o 18SrRNA_20_JC.nwk -dJC69 -m NJ</code></pre>

<h2 id="rate_heterogeneity_across_sites_gamma_distances"><a href="#rate_heterogeneity_across_sites_gamma_distances" class="header-anchor">Rate heterogeneity across sites: &#39;Gamma distances&#39;</a></h2>
<p>The assumption that all sites in the alignment evolve at the same rate is often problematic &#40;just think of the active site of an enzyme vs. some region with a purely structural function for instance&#41;. Accounting for heterogenity in substitution rates across sites can be done by assuming some distribution over <em>relative rates</em> across the alignment. In distance estimation, people often use a Gamma distribution to model rate differences across sites.</p>
<p>The Gamma distribution is fixed to a mean value of 1, so that the average relative rate across the alignment is 1 &#40;this is of course exactly what we mean by modeling <em>relative</em> rates&#41;. After fixing the mean to 1, there is a single free parameter left to specify the shape of the Gamma distribution, denoted \(\alpha\). Here is a plot of the Gamma distribution for different values of \(\alpha\)</p>

<pre><code class="language-julia">matrix, taxa, ntaxa &#61; readmatrix&#40;&quot;_assets/phylocourse/distance/18SrRNA_20_JCGamma_matrix.txt&quot;&#41;

<p>You can check this against FastME&#39;s NJ implementation, it should be correct. We have everything in place to start building our own extremely redundant phylogenetics library.</p>

In the original <a href="http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip/doc/main.html#inputfiles">PHYLIP format</a>, taxon names were restricted to 10 characters, hence the weird truncated names for the sequences.</td>

        <td class="fndef-content">For those unfamiliar with the command line, it will probably be easiest to put the FastME executable for your operating system &#40;for windows this is the <code>fastme.exe</code> file&#41; together with the data files in a separate new folder. On windows, you can then from within your file explorer application do <code>Shift&#43;right click</code> and click on <code>open command window here</code> or <code>open PowerShell window here</code>. Then you should be able to run the <code>fastme.exe</code> executable, e.g. <code>fastme -i 18SrRNA_20.phy -O 18SrRNA_20_JCmatrix.txt -d JC</code> provided the data file <code>18SrRNA_20.phy</code> is in the same directory as the <code>fastme.exe</code> executable. For Mac and linux users I would recommend a similar approach, make a directory where you put the executable and the data files, and open a terminal in that directory &#40;Linux users, you know how to do this, MacOS users, I can&#39;t help you, but google is your friend&#41;.
