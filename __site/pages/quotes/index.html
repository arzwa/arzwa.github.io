<div class="franklin-content"><p>&quot;The texture of Space is not that of Time, and the piebald four-dimensional sport that is bred by relativists is a quadruped with one leg replaced by the ghost of a leg.&quot; Nabokov - Ada or Ardor p.423</p>
<p>&quot;The format is deliberately space-delimited &#40;rather than tab-delimited&#41; and justified into aligned columns, so these files are suitable both for automated parsing and for human examination. I feel that tab-delimited data files are difficult for humans to examine and spot check. For this reason, I think tab-delimited files are a minor evil in the world. Although I occasionally receive shrieks of outrage about this, I still stubbornly feel that space-delimited files are just as easily parsed as tab-delimited files.&quot; Sean Eddy</p>
<p>&quot;The kind of people who become programmers and developers have ‘fun’ when the effort they have to put out to do a task challenges them, but is just within their capabilities. ‘Fun’ is therefore a sign of peak efficiency.&quot; Eric S. Raymond</p>
<p>&quot;&#91;...&#93; the infringement of one of humanity&#39;s main rights - that of enjoying the liberty of its evolution, a liberty no other creature had ever known.&quot; &#40;I think Taleb?&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;La science de la réalité ne se contente plus du &#39;comment&#39; phénoménologique ; elle cherche le &#39;pourquoi&#39; mathématique.&quot; - Gaston Bachelard </p>
<p>&quot;&#91;...&#93; to turn Merton on his head, the uniformity of nature presupposes universalism among scientists, rather than the reverse.&quot; Lorraine Daston - The moral economy of science</p>
<p>&quot;Yet Poisson reserved the traditional term &quot;probability&quot; for its traditional definition as &quot;the reason we have to believe that &#91;an event&#93; will or will not occur&quot; &#91;36, 30&#93;, letting &quot;chance&quot; designate &quot;events in themselves and independent of the knowledge we have of them&quot; &#91;36, 31&#93;. So, for example, the &quot;chances&quot; of heads or tails for a given coin are unlikely to be equal because of the physical asymmetries of all such objects, but the &quot;probability&quot; is nonetheless equal because we know nothing about the coin&#39;s constitution. For Poisson, both the &quot;chance&quot; of underlying causes and the &quot;probability&quot; of our ignorance were equally legitimate interpretations of what it was that mathematical probabilities measured.&quot; Lorraine Daston - How Probabilities Came to Be Objective and Subjective</p>
<p>&quot;The study of the cell has on the whole seemed to widen rather than to narrow the enormous gap that separates even the lowest forms of life from the inorganic world&quot; E.B. Wilson &#40;1897&#41; &#40;quoted in Bergson EC p. 36&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;The variations come first, the organisms to the best they can with them, and natural selection is the arbiter &#40;Darwin&#41;&quot; &#40;Sewall Wright - 1949&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;En fait, il est vrai, les mutations sont souvent des monstruosités. Mais, au regard de la vie, y a-t-il des monstruosités ? Que sont beaucoup de formes vivant encore aujourd&#39;hui, et bien vivantes, sinon des monstres normalisés?&quot; Canguilhem, Le concept et la vie &#40;p222&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;&#91;W&#93;hen sophistication loses content then the only way of keeping in touch with reality is to be crude and superficial. This is what I intend to be.&#91;23&#93;&quot; Feyerabend &#40;defend society against science&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;The existence of monsters calls into question the capacity of life to teach us order. This calling into question is immediate-so comprehensive was our prior confidence, so firmly accustomed had we been to seeing wild roses blooming on rosebushes, tadpoles turning into frogs, mares suckling foals, and, in general, the same engender the same. A breach in this confidence, a morphological divergence, an appearance equivocal as to its species is enough for us to be gripped by radical fear. Very well for fear, one might say. But why radical fear? Because we are living beings, real effects of the laws of life, and ourselves possible sources of life in our turn. A failure of life is of double concern to us, for such a failure could touch us or could come from us. <em>It is only because we humans are living beings that a morphological failure is, to our living eyes, a monster. If we were beings of pure reason, pure intellectual machines of observation, calculation, and explana­tion, and thus inert and indifferent to the occasions of our thinking, then the monster would be merely what is other than the same, an order other than the most probable order.</em>&quot; Georges Canguilhem</p>
<p>&quot;Biologists should realize that before long we shall have a subject which might be called ‘protein taxonomy ‘-the study of the amino acid sequences of the proteins of an organism and the comparison of them between species.  It can be argued that these sequences are the most delicate expression possible of the phenotype of an organism and that vast amounts of evolutionary information may be hidden away within them.&quot; - Crick &#40;On protein synthesis&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;While all these really exciting uses were being made of statistics, the ma-jority of statisticians themselves, led by Sir R.A. Fisher, were tying their hands behind their backs, insisting that statistics couldn&#39;t be used in any but totally reproducible situations and then only using the empirical data.&quot;  David Mumford &#40;2000&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;As a mathematical discipline travels far from its empirical source, or still more, if it is a second or third generation only indirectly inspired by ideas coming from “reality,“it is beset with very grave dangers. It becomes more and more purely aestheticizing, more and more purely l’art pour l’art. This need not be bad, if the field is surrounded by correlated subjects, which still have closer empirical connections, or if the discipline is under the influence of men with an excep- tionally well-developed taste. But there is a grave danger that the subject will develop along the line of least resistance, that the stream, so far from its source, will separate into a multitude of insignificant branches, and that the discipline will become a disorganized mass of details and complexities. In other words, at a great distance from its empirical source, or after much “abstract” inbreeding, a mathematical subject is in danger of degeneration.&quot; John Von Neumann</p>
<p>&quot;Just as deduction should be supplemented by intuition, so the impulse to progres- sive generalization must be tempered and balanced by respect and love for color- ful detail. The individual problem should not be degraded to the rank of special illustration of lofty general theories. In fact, general theories emerge from consid- eration of the specific, and they are meaningless if they do not serve to clarify and order the more particularized substance below. The interplay between generality and individuality, deduction and construction, logic and imagination—this is the profound essence of live mathematics. Any one or another of these aspects of mathematics can be at the center of a given achievement. In a far-reaching devel- opment all of them will be involved. Generally speaking, such a development will start from the “concrete” ground, then discard ballast by abstraction and rise to the lofty layers of thin air where navigation and observation are easy; after this flight comes the crucial test of landing and reaching specific goals in the newly surveyed low plains of individual “reality.” In brief, the flight into abstract generality must start from and return to the concrete and specific.&quot; Richard Courant</p>
<p>&quot;If the hallowed maximum likelihood principle leads us to difficulties, maybe some other principle will save us. There is indeed such a principle. It is as follows: <em>Basic Principle 0</em>. Don’t trust any principle. This applies in particular to the principles and recommendations listed below and should be kept in mind any time one encounters a problem worth studying. Anyway, here are some other principles &#91;... insert 8 other principles ...&#93;. Counting the Basic Principle, this makes a total of nine. Confucius had many more, but I tire easily.&quot; Lucien Le Cam - Maximum likelihood: an introduction</p>

<p>&quot;Het armzalige gepruts dat we overal aantreffen, heet in deze eeuw &#39;wetenschap&#39;&quot; Imre Kertesz - Kaddisj voor een niet geboren kind &#40;p. 92&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;&#91;...&#93; maar in dat gezag was geen spoor te vinden van het respect dat men voor waardevolle eigenschappen behoort te hebben, <em>het berustte, zoals elke vorm van gezag, alleen op een goed georganiseerde intimidatie.</em>&quot; Imre Kertesz - Kaddisj voor een niet geboren kind &#40;p. 98&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;I’d like to hold fast to the idea that identification, to the extent it means anything, must be defined as a function of model &#43; data, not just of the model. Sure, with a probability model, you can say that asymptotically you’ll get identification, but asymptotically we’re all dead, and in the meantime we have sparseness and separation and all sorts of other issues.&quot; Andrew Gelman &#40;<a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2014/02/12/think-identifiability-bayesian-inference/">12 Feb 2014</a>&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;An experimental science is supposed to perform experiments that find generalities. It&#39;s not just supposed to tally up a long list of individual cases and their unique life histories. That&#39;s butterfly collecting.&quot; Richard Lewontin</p>
<p>&quot;So is data analysis the most fundamental thing? Maybe so, but what method of data analysis? Last I heard, there are many schools. Bayesian data analysis, perhaps? Not so clear; what’s the motivation for modeling everything probabilistically? Sure, it’s coherent—but so is some mental patient who thinks he’s Napoleon and acts daily according to that belief. &quot; Andrew Gelman: Several reviews of Deborah Mayo’s new book, Statistical Inference as Severe Testing: How to Get Beyond the Statistics Wars &#40;12/04/19&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;Bayesians are frequentists. What I mean is, the Bayesian prior distribution corresponds to the frequentist sample space: it’s the set of problems for which a particular statistical model or procedure will be applied.&quot; Andrew Gelman &#40;<a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2018/06/17/bayesians-are-frequentists/">17 June 2018</a>&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;We hebben immers gezien dat dit &#91;het natuurkundige wereldbeeld&#93; weliswaar in principe geen realiteiten behoeft te loochenen die daar tot dusver geen plaats in hebben gevonden, maar dat het toch voortdurend moet vechten tegen de verleiding om dat wel te doen.&quot; C. F. von Weisz&auml;cker - Het wereldbeeld in de fysica &#40;p. 23&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;Hier ligt de moeilijkheid van de wetenschap in het algemeen &#91;...&#93;. Het praktische voordeel dat zij ons biedt, is dat zij ons steeds meer dingen leert beheersen, met als resultaat de techniek. Haar gevaar is dat zij ons zo gemakkelijk afhoudt van de persoonlijke inspanning die onmisbaar is om het levende contact met het geheel in stand te houden - en het gevolg daarvan is de ineenstorting van ons wereldbeeld.&quot; C. F. von Weisz&auml;cker - Het wereldbeeld in de fysica &#40;p. 21&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;It will be sufficient to state here my belief that, however much a Bayesian solution would have simplified the approach to this problem &#40;by calling everything a conditional probability&#41;, it would be most improper for a scientist to compromise his convictions by resorting to the most expedient approach to inference for the problem at hand; and a detailed study of the present problem has, if anything, strengthened my conviction that a Bayesian approach in this instance would be a gross over-simplification. I am not prepared to give the true parameters prior probability distributions because I can see no model which would justify them.&quot; A. W. F. Edwards &#40;1970&#41; &#91;Estimation of the branch points of a branching diffusion process&#93;</p>
<p>&quot;&#91;...&#93; science that exhausts the pity of the gods &#91;...&#93;&quot; Robert Ashley - Celestial Excursions &#40;Bruno pt. 1&#41; </p>
<p>&quot;That number is the answer, in the way that numbers answer.&quot; Robert Ashley - The Backyard</p>
<p>&quot;In a subject like philosophy it is really fatal to lose connexion with the open air of human nature, and to think in terms of shop-tradition only. In Germany the forms are so professionalized that anybody who has gained a teaching chair and written a book, however distorted and eccentric, has the legal right to figure forever in the history of the subject like a fly in amber. All later comers have the duty of quoting him and measuring their opinions with his opinion. Such are the rules of the professorial game — they think and write from each other and for each other and at each other exclusively. With this exclusion of the open air all true perspective gets lost, extremes and oddities count as much as sanities, and command the same attention.&quot; William James, quoted in Christopher Fuchs &#40;01/03/11&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;You know, the most amazing thing happened to me tonight. I was coming here, on the way to the lecture, and I came in through the parking lot. And you won’t believe what happened. I saw a car with the license plate ARW 357. Can you imagine? Of all the millions of license plates in the state, what was the chance that I would see that particular one tonight? Amazing&#33;&quot; Richard Feynman</p>
<p>&quot;Vrije tijd alleen, &#91;...&#93;, is daartoe niet voldoende: hiervoor is een duidelijk overschot aan intellectuele vermogens nodig. &#91;...&#93; Al naar gelang dit overschot klein of groot is, zijn er talloze niveau&#39; van dt naast het dagelijks leven te voeren intellectuele leven: van het simpele verzamelen van insekten, vogels, mineralen of munten tot aan de hoogste prestaties op het gebied van de po&euml;zie en filosofie.&quot; Arthur Schopenhauer - Bepiegelingen over levenswijsheid &#40;p. 40&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;From eight o&#39;clock to ten o&#39;clock real biologists work collecting data and doing science, but then for relaxation they run to the evolutionary playground, only to return, fortified and reenergized &#40;perhaps relieved&#41; by the gay abandon of speculation, to the stuff of which science and technology are really made.&quot;  Janis Antonovics</p>
<p>&quot;Ooit zal Louis, dat weet hij zeker, inzicht, overzicht krijgen in al die onaffe zinnen, toespelingen. Als je goed oplet, waakzaam bent, zullen de raadsels, die zij kruimelsgewijs in hun moppen en leugens laten ontsnappen, aan het licht komen, tot op het dunste draadje uitgerafeld worden.&quot; &#40;Louis Seynaeve&#41; Het Verdiet van Belgi&euml; - Hugo Claus &#40;p. 167&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;&#91;...&#93; But the history of thought proves that each new structure raised by a man of extraordinary intellect is sure to be pulled down by the succeeding ones. This constant pulling down and building up is all right as far as philosophy itself is concerned; for the inherent nature of the intellect, as I take it, demands it and we cannot put a stop to the progress of philosophical inquiries any more than to our breathing. But when it comes to the question of life itself we cannot wait for the ultimate solution to be offered by the intellect, even if it could do so.&quot; D. T. Suzuki in &quot;Zen Buddhism - Selected Writings of D. T. Suzuki&quot; &#40;p. 8&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;As Bergson has demonstrated, in order to distance ourselves from the objective world as well as to perceive aspects of it, consciousness does not &#39;add&#39; anything to the real, but substracts that which is of no interest&quot;. G. D. Adamson - Philosophy in the age of Science and Capital &#40;p. 20&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;&#91;...&#93; The instant conditions scientific thought and representation in its entirety, introducing a Platonism into science which is, as Bergson writes, &#39;immanent to the method&#39;.&quot; G. D. Adamson - Philosophy in the age of Science and Capital &#40;p. 40&#41;</p>
