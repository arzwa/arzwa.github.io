# # Brief probability recap
#
# We will need some basic notions of probability theory in order to be able to
# discuss models and methods in statistical phylogenetics. Here I provide a
# *very* brief and *informal* recap of some important aspects of probability
# theory. Needless to say, this neither does justice to the philosophical
# subtlety of notions such as 'probability', 'plausibility', 'chance' or
# randomness, nor does it to the mathematically sophisticated formal theory
# of probability.
#
# There are multiple ways of thinking about probabilities, and this is a source
# of endless controversy, debate and confusion. Intuitively, we may consider
# two not unrelated notions:
#
# 1. The probability of an *event* is the *relative frequency* of that event
#    in a large number of trials.
# 2. The probability of a proposition is the degree of belief some rational 
#    agent has that the proposition is true
