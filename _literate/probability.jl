# # Brief probability recap
#
# Consider a *proposition* $A$, that is, a sentence which is either true or
# false (it has a definite truth value). $A$ can be anything, like "a coin toss
# lands heads", "tomorrow it will rain", "the curtains turn yellow", "I will go to
# the toilet in the next four hours", "there is a magpie in my garden right now"
# you name it.
#
# Although all of these proposition have a definite truth value, *we* are faced
# with a situation of uncertainty. We do not know the truth or falsity of many
# propositions, and are often in a position that it is impossible for us to
# figure out the truth or falsity of some proposition. Now, we may have some
# judgement on the relative *plausibilities* of these propositions. For
# instance, although I cannot know whether "this coin toss will land heads" is
# a true statement I do believe this proposition to be more plausible than the
# proposition "the next five coin tosses will all land heads". Similarly I
# am firmly convinced that the proposition "the dice throw will result in a
# value lower than 5" is more plausible than the proposition "the dice will
# land on a 6".
#
# Probability theory provides *a* way to reason in the face of uncertainty.
# This is not the only conception of what probability theory deals with, nor is
# it the only way to deal with uncertainty.
