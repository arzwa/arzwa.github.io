In the early 90s, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_J._Acer">dentist</a> was accused of infecting several of his patients with HIV during surgical procedures. After a &quot;low-risk&quot; patient was diagnosed with HIV, other patients were screened, a coupe of which had HIV.</p> <p><img src="/assets/phylocourse/img/tabloid.jpg" alt="" /></p> <p>In the file <code>hiv-dentist.fasta</code> you&#39;ll find sequences from the V3 region of the <em>env</em> gene of the HIV virus from the dentist, the patients and some local controls &#40;AIDS patients from Florida that had no relationship to the dentist whatsoever&#41;. These sequences are unaligned, so you&#39;ll first need to align them. You can download software like MUSCLE, MAFFT or PRANK for that, or alternatively, you could run any of these tools online at EBI <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/"><code>https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/</code></a>.</p> <p>After you have obtained an alignment, you can visualize it with some tool like <code>aliview</code>, <code>seaview</code> or <code>alv</code>, or again, you can use some of the webservices at EBI like <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/mview/"><code>Mview</code></a>.</p> <p>Now infer a tree with IQ-TREE, try <code>-m JC</code>, <code>-m JC&#43;G</code> and ModelFinder &#40;by omitting the <code>-m</code> option&#41;. Remember that you can include bootstrapping by setting <code>-bb &lt;number of bootstrap replicates you want&gt;</code>.</p> <blockquote> <ul> <li><p>Based on the phylogeny, what can you conclude about the crime case?</p> <li><p>Would your conclusion change when using different substitution models?</p> <li><p>Why do you think they chose to sequence the <em>env</em> gene of HIV for the phylogenetic analyses?</p> <li><p>Have a look at the <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/256/5060/1165">original paper</a>, how did they conduct the phylogenetic analysis? Do you obtain similar conclusions?</p> </ul> </blockquote> <div class=page-foot > <div class=copyright > &copy; Arthur Zwaenepoel. Last modified: April 19, 2020.
