I am at the airport in Oslo. It's an incredible sight, which reminds me of some Touch
record (I think it's the back of Venice from Fennesz right?). 

## Research

I should definitely return to those infinitesimal model studies, I think it's quite 
cool and it should get uch more complex, maay be it would already work with what I 
have. Definitely worth doing in some free time while finishing the reconciliation
study.

I still do not have a very good idea how to solve the current issues with WHALE, to 
sum up again:

- ML works for low dimensional problems, unable to account very well for rate
  heterogeneity 
- MCMC mixes terribly when allowing WGDs, also without WGDs there seem to be 
  particular branches with very poor mixing.  I am not entirely sure if the branch-
  wise DL+WGD model as in the Bayesian approach is actually (fully) identifiable

There are multiple possibly fruitful directions to look in to solve this problem:

- Try to improve the MCMC by looking for clever proporsals, MC3, etc.
- Have a look at other Bayesian approaches which are more efficient (e.g. VB)
- Skip the Bayesian approach and use EM to get a quick estimate of the branch-wise 
  rates, use these estiates as a starting point for Nelder-Mead optimization, 
  possibly with WGDs. [con - then I use the EM algorithm of Wandrille and Gergely, 
  so if my study is finished before the studies of Wandrille and colleagues I might
  scoop them to some extent which wouldn't be nice]

Maybe I'll start next week with the second, reading a bit on VB approaches and how 
they work.
