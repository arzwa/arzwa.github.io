[These tracks](https://bruinebeer.bandcamp.com/album/non-particular-dream) have been laying around for quite a while, and I have always  enjoyed them myself. However they have only been released in the most obscure places: there was this vuilbak compilation cassette called 'Stort Vol.2', which was a limited edition release of size 3 (a threefold increase compared to Stort Vol.1!), and one of the tracks could be found somewhere on the [vuilbak record-label website](www.vuilbak.in). Now these are collected under the title *Non-particular dream*. In the words of the great composer:

>"For those who love such things, and in particular for those who are familiar with comparable work, for the delight of their souls".
