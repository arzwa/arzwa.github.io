Continuing my lonely journal club, I stumbled on this paper today:

```
Gilbert, K.J., Sharp, N.P., Angert, A.L., Conte, G.L., Draghi, J.A., Guillaume, F., Hargreaves, A.L., Matthey-Doret, R., Whitlock, M.C., 2018.
Local Adaptation Interacts with Expansion Load during Range Expansion: Maladaptation Reduces Expansion Load.
The American Naturalist 189, no 4

And as I am quite interested in the population genetics of local adaptation and adaptation to climate change I took a look. While reading, an interesting concept previously unknown to me (or at least the term to describe it was unknown to me) was discussed, for which the term '**allele surfing**' has been coined (Klopfstein *et al.* 2006). Quoting Gilbert *et al.*:

> "[...] This leads to the process of allele surfing (Klopfstein *et al.* 2006), whereby a deleterious mutation that arises at the range edge is more likely to drift to high frequency than it would if it arose in the denser core of the species range. Because selection is inefficient, strongly deleterious alleles may persist and reach higher frequencies than expected in a population at equilibrium (Peischl and Excoffier 2015). Theoretical work shows that allele surfing is the main cause of increased deleterious allele frequency within recently expanded populations (Excoffier *et al.* 2009). The reduction in fitness due to the accumulation of these deleterious alleles is termed expansion load (Peischl *et al.* 2013; Peischl and Excoffier 2015)."

This statement connects the process of allele surfing to the concept of **expansion load**, which might affect a population when undergoing range displacement as a response to environmental change. Indeed, while tracking its climatic optimum, a population resists global extinction but induces successive founder events, with a smaller effective population size in the newly entered range and stronger drift as a result.

The paper by Gilbert *et al.* is concerned with the interplay of this process with the problem of genetic swamping, which I have examined to quite some extent before. This is the process whereby maladaptive gene flow from the more populous center of the species' range counteracts ('swamps') local adaptation at the range margins. This process can also be viewed in terms of load as a 'migrational load'. How do the combined effects of maladaptive gene flow (causing migrational load) and allele surfing (causing expansion load) affect a population that is expanding (or displacing)? These are the questions addressed by Gilbert *et al.*

Another cool paper on allele surfing and expansion load is the following

In which they have a real cool figure of surfing alleles in asexual populations!
