>"The Smiths have two children. At least one of them is a boy. What is the
>probability that both children are boys?"

This problem is very clear from a Jaynesian perspective, define the following
propositions:


$$ B_1 \equiv \text{the first child is a boy} $$

$$ B_2 \equiv \text{the second child is a boy} $$

$$ C \equiv \text{at least one of them is a boy} $$

$$ X \equiv \text{everything we know about the Smiths and the human species} $$

We know $P(B_1\|X) = P(B_2\|X) = P(B_1\|B_2X) = P(B_2\|B_1X) = 1/2$. We have by the product rule 

$$ P(B_1B_2|CX) = \frac{P(B_1B_2C|X)}{P(C|X)} $$ 

with $P(B_1B_2C\|X) = P(B_1B_2\|X)$ of course since $B_1B_2 \implies C$ and 

$$P(B_1B_2|X) = P(B_1|B_2X)P(B_2|X) = 1/4$$ 

We also have 

$$ P(C|X) = P(B_1 + B_2|X) = P(B_1|X) + P(B_2|X) - P(B_1B_2|X)$$ 

by the sum and product rule which gives $1/2 + 1/2 - 1/4 = 3/4$ 
We have thus 

$$P(B_1B_2|CX) = 1/4 \times 4/3 = 1/3$$
