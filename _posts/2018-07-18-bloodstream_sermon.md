title: Bloodstream Sermon - Jefre Cantu-Ledesma

Dried blades of grass wiggled by a soft wind, showing minimal resistance, seem to feel the microscopic dynamics of this music. These drones are all about texture, the ruggedness and roughness of an unpolished concrete wall. This is *wabi sabi* as far as I understand it. A music which feels comfortingly timeless, yet acknowledges the deciduous and perishable nature of things. It is perhaps a recurrent quality of ambient music to express these intuitions, most directly present in Basinski's Disintegration Loops, but far from absent in this superficially highly persistent drone music of Jefre Cantu-Ledesma. The contrast between the timeless universe evoked by this music and the textural humbleness and imperfectness in the actual noise gives us the quintessential ambient music experience. One could hardly propose a better title for this music. The impermanent, yet everlasting recurrence of life is evoked and transcended in this music.
