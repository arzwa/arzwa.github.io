In his 1975 paper, Donald Levin proposed the first model of polyploid population establishment. Polyploidy was already for some time acknowledged as a feature of evolutionary interest in botany, but to my knowledge, Levin was the first to provide a (simple) mathematical description of the problem of cytotype coexistence. The model is inspired by population genetics, but instead of following alleles in a population, cytotypes (specifically diploids & tetraploids) are followed. Important to note is that Levin did not consider formation of tetraploids.

Levin models two coexisting cytotypes which undergo random mating (with some degree of selfing). Inter-cytotype matings are assumed to lead to inviable and infertile offspring. In Levin's model, the proportion of the two cytotypes are denoted as $p$ and $q$. The frequency of within-cytotype matings is given by $p^2$ for the first cytotype and $q^2$ for the second cytotype. The frequency of between-cytotype matings is of course $2pq$. To see the strong frequency dependent effect under this model, consider the proportion of failed matings for each cytotype, given by $\frac{2pq}{p} = 2q = 2(1-p)$ for the first cytotype and analogously by $2p$ for the second cytotype. The main observation is thus that *the proportion of failed matings increases for lower population sizes*, which Levin called the minority cytotype disadvantage, leading to minority cytotype exclusion (MCE).

Indeed after one generation, the frequency of the first cytotype is given by $p' = \frac{p^2}{p^2 + q^2}$, giving a change in cytotype proportion of

$$\begin{eqnarray}
\Delta p &=& \frac{p^2}{p^2 + q^2} - p \\
         &=& \frac{p^2q - q^2p}{p^2 + q^2} \\
\end{eqnarray}$$

and likewise $ \Delta q = \frac{q^2p - p^2q}{p^2 + q^2} = -\Delta p $. This clearly shows how the minority cytotype disadvantage leads to minority cytotype exclusion. This is illustrated in the following plot:

Levin further incorporates selfing. With selfing probability $s$, the proportion of successful matings of course increases to $p^2(1-s) + ps$ (why not $p^2(1-s)^2 + ps$?). The above expressions can be adjusted for selfing as follows

$$\Delta p = \frac{p^2(1-s) + ps}{p^2(1-s) + s + q^2(1-s)} - p$$

I think (note that $ps + qs = (p+q)s = s$).
